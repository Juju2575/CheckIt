      "Document: Modeling Agencies Enabled Sexual Predators For Years, Former Agent Says. In October 2017, Carolyn Kramer received a disturbing phone call. The former modeling agent listened intently as a model she used to represent told her that a famous French photographer, who still shoots for top publications, raped her when she was 16. Shortly after meeting the man at a restaurant in 1983, the model said she blacked out after drinking one glass of champagne, then woke up in his bed the next morning with a sore and bruised vagina. The woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed this story with HuffPost, but did not want to name the photographer for fear of legal repercussions. “He was one of the photographers that agents and clients and young girls basically knew was lecherous,” Kramer said, claiming that she and other agents sent their models to him in the ’80s anyway. “[But] what I didn’t realize [at the time] is that he was raping girls.”  Kramer said she broke down crying after the woman relayed her story of assault. “In that moment I felt that I let down the models who I represented over the course of 20 years,” she said. “It made me feel like, here it is in front of my face now and I didn’t do anything to change [it.]” It’s been 14 years since Kramer left the fashion business. But throughout the two decades she spent working as a modeling agent in New York City in the 1980s, ’90s and early 2000s, Kramer said she knew about rampant sexual misconduct in her industry ― and didn’t protect her models from the egregious behavior. Now, amid the domino-like fall of so many high-profile alleged sexual offenders, the 58-year-old can’t stop thinking about how she and other agents sent girls, some as young as 13, to modeling gigs with photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators. So in October, the former agent decided to speak out.  “Many of these girls who are assaulted [as models] aren’t older than 15 years old,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “And I stand here to say how ashamed I am of myself for not having had the tools or the resources or guts to stop it.” Kramer’s peers queued up in the post’s comments section to corroborate her story. One of her former colleagues, ex-model Kristen Noel, said her agency, Elite Model Management, sent her to Paris in the early ’80s to stay with an agent who repeatedly groped and forcibly kissed her. She was 16. “Elite protected him and disconnected from their responsibility to me,” Noel told HuffPost.  Another commenter, hair and makeup artist Dawn Jacobson, said she saw agencies regularly endanger models when she worked in Milan in the ’80s. According to her, companies sent young women to live in residences ― one of which was reportedly known as “Clitoride,” Italian for “clitoris” ― where they were preyed on by wealthy Italian men. “I think the agencies have massive culpability because they don’t necessarily care about anything other than who gets the booking,” the 59-year-old, who still works in fashion, told HuffPost. “It becomes a little bit of a human trafficking kind of thing.” Kramer’s post, her first public denouncement of the sexual harassment and abuse she’d witnessed and heard about in the fashion industry, clearly struck a nerve. As the #MeToo revolution continues to spark a national dialogue on sexual misconduct, the former agent wants to expose exactly how the very modeling agencies she worked for enabled predators, a disturbing reality that she believes still exists today.  Kramer, a New Jersey native, doesn’t seem like the type to stay silent. She has a self-described “big personality” and speaks bluntly with a slight New York accent. In a recent Facebook profile photo, she’s wearing a shirt that reads “Fuck Trump” and raising her middle finger. But since she retired from the fashion world in 2004, Kramer said she felt like nobody ― primarily, the media ― was interested in what she had to say.  Only recently, the former agent noted, have news outlets begun systematically covering the kinds of abuse allegations she wants to condemn. It’s true that sexual assault accusations made against fashion photographer Terry Richardson date back to 2001, and that he was only officially dropped by certain top magazines and brands in October 2017. (Richardson has long denied any nonconsensual behavior.) And while at least 18 current and former male models recently accused famed photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment (Weber has denied these claims), one of whom has filed a lawsuit, industry insiders claim there is a long list of predators who still thrive in a largely unregulated profession that combines young models, big male egos and drugs.  Kramer’s story dates back to 1983, when she was hired by the industry’s top agency, Elite Model Management, as an assistant booking agent in New York. Her previous fashion industry jobs had been horrible. Kramer once worked with a photographer who she said cornered her in his office and tried to forcibly kiss her. And she worked for Foster-Fell Model Management, which she called a “slimy, horrible” agency.  “The models were basically prostitutes,” she said. ”[The owner] would have parties I would be at with licentious business men who were only there to fuck the models.” (Jeremy Foster-Fell, who co-founded the now-defunct agency in 1970, denied these claims to HuffPost. “To say there was an arrangement of financial exchange and sexual favors would be completely out of whack,” he said, adding, however, that “if you’re looking after a whole bunch of good-looking ladies who are running around Manhattan, you’re going to be running into trouble here and there sometimes.”)  But at 24, Kramer found herself employed by the modeling world’s gold standard, an agency that represented Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, where she didn’t expect to encounter abusive men. Her transition to Elite was “like going from community college to Harvard,” she said. Sadly, Kramer’s optimism was quickly dashed.  At Elite New York, her job frequently involved booking models on “go-sees,” the name for appointments during which photographers or designers scout new faces for upcoming shoots. In these meetings, vulnerable young women’s success often depends on impressing (mostly) powerful men. Kramer said she and other Elite agents would send models, who in many cases were under 16 and had never been to New York City, on appointments with nothing more than subway fare and a map. According to Kramer, the girls mostly went alone, because at the time there were no laws requiring guardians to accompany underage models on shoots. New York passed a bill in 2013 that, among other things, requires models under 16 to have chaperones. But before that, a 2012 study by Model Alliance, an organization that advocates for labor rights in fashion, found that 52 percent of models are rarely or never accompanied by guardians to a shoot, despite the fact that the majority of models start working between age 13 and 16. Kramer quickly learned about the perils of go-sees and photo shoots. Though the former agent says that the models she represented at the time didn’t tell her directly about being sexually harassed or assaulted by photographers ― likely, she said, because they were terrified of losing job opportunities ― Kramer soon heard through industry gossip with colleagues who the predators were. “I wouldn’t have even called it a secret,” she said. “It was just sort of common hearsay that this list of photographers were pigs...I had to make the appointments with [these men]. It would make me gag, but I had to do my job or I’d be fired.”  Another Elite employee, Marie Anderson Boyd, who was an agent and vice president at the company’s Chicago office between 1985 and 1990, said models would regularly tell her about the sexual misconduct they experienced on go-sees. ”[Some photographers] will think nothing of walking over to some teen girl who’s brand new to the business, taking her top off, unbuttoning her bra and saying something like, ‘I want you to look at me and think of ... giving me oral sex,’” she said. “And a lot of girls have never even done that [before], so they don’t even know what the [photographers] mean.”  Anderson Boyd said she never told her managers at Elite about the models’ abusive stories, in part because executives like John Casablancas and Gerald Marie also allegedly engaged in misconduct. “They established a culture of compliance with sexually predatory behavior,” she said. “That trickled down into everything everybody did.”  Indeed, during Kramer’s first year at Elite, the agency’s late founder, the then-41-year-old Casablancas, was having a public affair with an underage model named Stephanie Seymour. Kramer was horrified that Casablancas, with his movie-star good looks and “intoxicating” charisma, was committing statutory rape.  “As a young little upstart, I was very in awe of him,” she said. “But at the same time I’m thinking to myself, Stephanie’s supposed to be at a Vogue shooting at 9 a.m. and she’s still in bed with John. I thought it was wrong and I honestly couldn’t believe it went on. It made me sick.” Other alleged abuses at Elite unfurled from there. Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris, was in his 30s when he allegedly raped a 17-year-old model named Carré Otis on multiple occasions, which she detailed in her 2011 memoir. At the time, Otis was temporarily staying with him while she was modeling abroad in the mid-’80s. She didn’t feel as though she could tell the agency about the abuse.  “When [Elite] New York said goodbye to me and put me in Gerald’s apartment, he was like my new owner,” Otis told HuffPost. “There was no one in New York who created a connection with me and said, ‘Hey, here’s the way it should go, and if it doesn’t go this way, here’s a number to call.’ It was just really a hand-off.” “There was a below-the-radar understanding that the [executives] of Elite [Casablancas and Marie] were sleeping with young women,” Kramer said. “I’m working at an agency where statutory rape is in front of my face and yet I can’t do anything.” Kramer said at 24 she herself was groped by a high-profile agent who went on to become an Elite executive. “I was sitting on his lap and his hands were all over me, coming around [my waist] and trying to grab my breast,” she said. “I didn’t react because I was so accustomed to seeing photographers be touchy-feely with models.” Kramer did not tell anyone at Elite about the misconduct, because she said it never occurred to her that such commonplace behavior was worth reporting, never mind addressing. And those who tried to call out problematic behavior didn’t get very far. In 2000, Anderson Boyd told New York Magazine that she remembered watching two female executives plead with Marie and Casablancas to stop sleeping with underage women. Anderson Boyd says Marie’s response was, “We are men. We have our needs.” “I was grossed out by what was happening,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost. “And that’s why I quit.” Ultimately, Anderson Boyd and Kramer agreed that Elite never trained agents to speak with models about sexual misconduct. Both women say they and other agents they knew did not prepare models for how to deal with predatory behavior.   “It was not handled like a traditional corporation where you’re handed a sexual harassment manual,” Anderson Boyd said. “I did not know how to help [the models’] working conditions.” Their account matches the experiences of women at other agencies at the time. For example, when former model Lesa Amoore was 17, she said her agent at the now-defunct Riccardo Gay Model Management company warned her that a photographer she was about to shoot with in Milan could “be a little weird.” Amoore said that during the subsequent shoot, when she was wearing only a bra and underwear, the photographer unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis and asked whether he could masturbate. According to the former model, now 48, she put on her clothes and ran out of the room. Amoore said that when she told her agent about the photographer’s behavior, he responded, “I’m so sorry, that happens sometimes with him.” Sara Ziff, who began modeling at age 14 in the late ’90s and later founded Model Alliance, told The New York Times last year that she too was regularly asked by photographers to get naked or topless without prior warning and, in at least one instance, was told to sit on her male booker’s lap.  “When I first started modeling, I did not feel protected by my agency [Next Management],” she told HuffPost. “In some cases, I felt like they were facilitating meetings [with powerful people] that were not clearly work opportunities ― they felt more like being set up on a date.” Though the modeling industry is now more regulated than it was in decades past, abuse is reportedly still frequent. A whopping 87 percent of models say they’ve been asked to get naked without prior warning, while 30 percent have experienced “inappropriate touching” on the job and 28 percent have been pressured to have sex at work, according to Model Alliance. Model Cameron Russell’s Instagram is filled with her own colleagues’ stories of being preyed on at go-sees and shoots. A 22-year-old model wrote about how a male photographer pulled down her bra and started kissing her breasts six months ago. Another woman recalled how, as a 14-year-old model, a photographer made her change in front of him, rubbed oil on her legs, and, after asking if she was a virgin, said, “You make me want to go to jail.” The collection of horror stories portrays male photographers masturbating in front of young models, asking for sexual favors, and, in one case, penetrating a 15-year-old with his finger to make the photos “look more sensual.” Ziff said that beyond adhering to the 2013 bill, even the best-intentioned agencies still don’t have firm policies in place to protect their models from sexual misconduct. “They tell the girls that if they are in a situation that feels uncomfortable: ‘Go to the bathroom and walk out,’ ‘Feel free to call me,’ and ‘You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,’” the 35-year-old explained. “[They should] take a preventative approach that doesn’t allow those situations to happen in the first place. It’s much easier said than done to walk out of a shoot, especially if you’re young, maybe English isn’t your first language, and you’re working with someone who could make or break your career.”  In fact, Model Alliance found that 70 percent of models surveyed didn’t feel they could report sexual misconduct to their agencies. Of those who did, two-thirds said their agents didn’t consider the behavior problematic, and, in a few cases, even encouraged models to sleep with predators to advance their careers.  Model Jason Boyce, who filed a lawsuit against Bruce Weber for sexual misconduct last year, is also suing his agency, Soul Artist Management. According to the court filing, Boyce claimed the agency knew about Weber’s predatory behavior and alleged that his agent told him to “nail” his shoot with the famous photographer. “The culture was: You did what you were told. That was how they sold it,” he said in an interview with The Business of Fashion. “If you do what I tell you, you’ll make it. ... My agent told me that all the time.” Jilian Gotlib, a manager and booking agent who worked for Elite in the ’80s and re-joined the company in 2005, spoke to HuffPost on behalf of the organization. She disputed Kramer’s assertion that agents knowingly sent models to photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators, suggesting that Kramer “goes overboard, maybe, with criticizing the industry.” “We would always be careful, check out [the photographer] and tell our models, ‘If [the photographers] ask you to do anything that we didn’t tell you was going to happen, let us know,’” she explained. “Some girls would just go ahead anyway, but we would always warn people: ‘Call me if anything seems untoward.’ I think we would try not to work with a lot of those photographers if we heard problems.” Trudi Tapscott, who worked as an agent and director at Elite from the early ’80s until the early ’90s, reiterated Gotlib’s point, explaining that she told young women about potentially creepy photographers ahead of time. “I’ve had very honest conversations [about] what to do when [photographers] do this and what to do when [photographers] do that,” she told HuffPost. However, Tapscott added: “At this point I consider [those conversations] complicit. But then I thought I was helping them survive, which sounds so stupid now.” As for alleged in-house predators such as Marie, Gotlib said, “I knew nothing about anything that might have been going on there.”  Throughout her career Kramer worked at four other agencies ― the now-defunct Name Management and Company Management, as well as Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency ― where she said she also regularly witnessed young girls being preyed on at dinner parties and clubs. She said agencies organized events at hot spots such as New York’s Indochine or the Ritz in Paris, where models mingled in clouds of cigarette smoke with important editors and photographers who could “make or break careers.” “I saw 14- and 15-year-olds sitting on the laps of these photographers,” she said. “These guys would just have their hands all over these girls.” Ultimately, Kramer said she didn’t think she could call out the complicit behavior without losing her job. “Working for Elite [and the other agencies] manipulated me into thinking it was OK,” she said. “I’m not trying to squiggle out of this, by the way. I’m sick to my stomach that I was part of this poison. It sickens me.”  Representatives for Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Kramer left the industry in 2004 when she was working at the Marilyn Model Agency, saying she was disgusted by how young the models had become. But the former agent said she didn’t process the sexual misconduct ― or her role in enabling it ― until the following year, when she planned to write a book about her career. “I really started becoming more in touch with, ‘Holy shit, what did I do? What did I see? What did I feel? What did I know?’” she said. Kramer never wrote the book, but since her October Facebook post, models have contacted her with more and more stories recalling sexual harassment and assault in the fashion world. Even before posting on social media, Kramer had started working with Ziff at Model Alliance to publicize industry abuse. The organization recently proposed a program to address sexual misconduct in the fashion, entertainment and media industries that would, among other things, have a third party provide sexual harassment training and implement proper complaint procedures. But Kramer says agents still working in the business aren’t embracing her efforts. “A lot of people aren’t talking to me anymore because they know I’m on top of this,” she said. “They are afraid of losing their standing with these photographers and editors.” There are still many “Terry Richardsons” in the industry, Kramer said, men whose predatory behavior the fashion world ignores. “We all knew Terry Richardson was sexually abusing these girls and yet we still kept sending them on go-sees and to the bookings themselves,” she said. “If you’ve got a $20 million Revlon contract weighing in the balance ... yet you know Terry is abusing these girls, what do we do? Do we say no to Terry? No, [we] don’t.” Moving forward, Kramer believes that if executives at top agencies spoke out about malpractice, they could truly force industrywide change. Kramer also thinks agencies need to stop accepting models under 16, but at the very least, she urges them to better protect young women against possible predators.  “If I could get the owners to say to themselves, ‘Maybe we shouldn’t send 14-year-olds out on go-sees,’ and, ‘Maybe we should make sure these photographers that are on the blacklist are never alone with a model,’ I would feel my own shame and guilt for not having done more when I was an agent [slightly dissipate],” she said. “[Then] maybe I’d be able to let myself off the hook a little bit.” Do you have a story about harassment or discrimination that you’d like to share?

      "Document: Modeling Agencies Enabled Sexual Predators For Years, Former Agent Says. In October 2017, Carolyn Kramer received a disturbing phone call. The former modeling agent listened intently as a model she used to represent told her that a famous French photographer, who still shoots for top publications, raped her when she was 16. Shortly after meeting the man at a restaurant in 1983, the model said she blacked out after drinking one glass of champagne, then woke up in his bed the next morning with a sore and bruised vagina. The woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed this story with HuffPost, but did not want to name the photographer for fear of legal repercussions. “He was one of the photographers that agents and clients and young girls basically knew was lecherous,” Kramer said, claiming that she and other agents sent their models to him in the ’80s anyway. “[But] what I didn’t realize [at the time] is that he was raping girls.”  Kramer said she broke down crying after the woman relayed her story of assault. “In that moment I felt that I let down the models who I represented over the course of 20 years,” she said. “It made me feel like, here it is in front of my face now and I didn’t do anything to change [it.]” It’s been 14 years since Kramer left the fashion business. But throughout the two decades she spent working as a modeling agent in New York City in the 1980s, ’90s and early 2000s, Kramer said she knew about rampant sexual misconduct in her industry ― and didn’t protect her models from the egregious behavior. Now, amid the domino-like fall of so many high-profile alleged sexual offenders, the 58-year-old can’t stop thinking about how she and other agents sent girls, some as young as 13, to modeling gigs with photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators. So in October, the former agent decided to speak out.  “Many of these girls who are assaulted [as models] aren’t older than 15 years old,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “And I stand here to say how ashamed I am of myself for not having had the tools or the resources or guts to stop it.” Kramer’s peers queued up in the post’s comments section to corroborate her story. One of her former colleagues, ex-model Kristen Noel, said her agency, Elite Model Management, sent her to Paris in the early ’80s to stay with an agent who repeatedly groped and forcibly kissed her. She was 16. “Elite protected him and disconnected from their responsibility to me,” Noel told HuffPost.  Another commenter, hair and makeup artist Dawn Jacobson, said she saw agencies regularly endanger models when she worked in Milan in the ’80s. According to her, companies sent young women to live in residences ― one of which was reportedly known as “Clitoride,” Italian for “clitoris” ― where they were preyed on by wealthy Italian men. “I think the agencies have massive culpability because they don’t necessarily care about anything other than who gets the booking,” the 59-year-old, who still works in fashion, told HuffPost. “It becomes a little bit of a human trafficking kind of thing.” Kramer’s post, her first public denouncement of the sexual harassment and abuse she’d witnessed and heard about in the fashion industry, clearly struck a nerve. As the #MeToo revolution continues to spark a national dialogue on sexual misconduct, the former agent wants to expose exactly how the very modeling agencies she worked for enabled predators, a disturbing reality that she believes still exists today.  Kramer, a New Jersey native, doesn’t seem like the type to stay silent. She has a self-described “big personality” and speaks bluntly with a slight New York accent. In a recent Facebook profile photo, she’s wearing a shirt that reads “Fuck Trump” and raising her middle finger. But since she retired from the fashion world in 2004, Kramer said she felt like nobody ― primarily, the media ― was interested in what she had to say.  Only recently, the former agent noted, have news outlets begun systematically covering the kinds of abuse allegations she wants to condemn. It’s true that sexual assault accusations made against fashion photographer Terry Richardson date back to 2001, and that he was only officially dropped by certain top magazines and brands in October 2017. (Richardson has long denied any nonconsensual behavior.) And while at least 18 current and former male models recently accused famed photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment (Weber has denied these claims), one of whom has filed a lawsuit, industry insiders claim there is a long list of predators who still thrive in a largely unregulated profession that combines young models, big male egos and drugs.  Kramer’s story dates back to 1983, when she was hired by the industry’s top agency, Elite Model Management, as an assistant booking agent in New York. Her previous fashion industry jobs had been horrible. Kramer once worked with a photographer who she said cornered her in his office and tried to forcibly kiss her. And she worked for Foster-Fell Model Management, which she called a “slimy, horrible” agency.  “The models were basically prostitutes,” she said. ”[The owner] would have parties I would be at with licentious business men who were only there to fuck the models.” (Jeremy Foster-Fell, who co-founded the now-defunct agency in 1970, denied these claims to HuffPost. “To say there was an arrangement of financial exchange and sexual favors would be completely out of whack,” he said, adding, however, that “if you’re looking after a whole bunch of good-looking ladies who are running around Manhattan, you’re going to be running into trouble here and there sometimes.”)  But at 24, Kramer found herself employed by the modeling world’s gold standard, an agency that represented Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, where she didn’t expect to encounter abusive men. Her transition to Elite was “like going from community college to Harvard,” she said. Sadly, Kramer’s optimism was quickly dashed.  At Elite New York, her job frequently involved booking models on “go-sees,” the name for appointments during which photographers or designers scout new faces for upcoming shoots. In these meetings, vulnerable young women’s success often depends on impressing (mostly) powerful men. Kramer said she and other Elite agents would send models, who in many cases were under 16 and had never been to New York City, on appointments with nothing more than subway fare and a map. According to Kramer, the girls mostly went alone, because at the time there were no laws requiring guardians to accompany underage models on shoots. New York passed a bill in 2013 that, among other things, requires models under 16 to have chaperones. But before that, a 2012 study by Model Alliance, an organization that advocates for labor rights in fashion, found that 52 percent of models are rarely or never accompanied by guardians to a shoot, despite the fact that the majority of models start working between age 13 and 16. Kramer quickly learned about the perils of go-sees and photo shoots. Though the former agent says that the models she represented at the time didn’t tell her directly about being sexually harassed or assaulted by photographers ― likely, she said, because they were terrified of losing job opportunities ― Kramer soon heard through industry gossip with colleagues who the predators were. “I wouldn’t have even called it a secret,” she said. “It was just sort of common hearsay that this list of photographers were pigs...I had to make the appointments with [these men]. It would make me gag, but I had to do my job or I’d be fired.”  Another Elite employee, Marie Anderson Boyd, who was an agent and vice president at the company’s Chicago office between 1985 and 1990, said models would regularly tell her about the sexual misconduct they experienced on go-sees. ”[Some photographers] will think nothing of walking over to some teen girl who’s brand new to the business, taking her top off, unbuttoning her bra and saying something like, ‘I want you to look at me and think of ... giving me oral sex,’” she said. “And a lot of girls have never even done that [before], so they don’t even know what the [photographers] mean.”  Anderson Boyd said she never told her managers at Elite about the models’ abusive stories, in part because executives like John Casablancas and Gerald Marie also allegedly engaged in misconduct. “They established a culture of compliance with sexually predatory behavior,” she said. “That trickled down into everything everybody did.”  Indeed, during Kramer’s first year at Elite, the agency’s late founder, the then-41-year-old Casablancas, was having a public affair with an underage model named Stephanie Seymour. Kramer was horrified that Casablancas, with his movie-star good looks and “intoxicating” charisma, was committing statutory rape.  “As a young little upstart, I was very in awe of him,” she said. “But at the same time I’m thinking to myself, Stephanie’s supposed to be at a Vogue shooting at 9 a.m. and she’s still in bed with John. I thought it was wrong and I honestly couldn’t believe it went on. It made me sick.” Other alleged abuses at Elite unfurled from there. Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris, was in his 30s when he allegedly raped a 17-year-old model named Carré Otis on multiple occasions, which she detailed in her 2011 memoir. At the time, Otis was temporarily staying with him while she was modeling abroad in the mid-’80s. She didn’t feel as though she could tell the agency about the abuse.  “When [Elite] New York said goodbye to me and put me in Gerald’s apartment, he was like my new owner,” Otis told HuffPost. “There was no one in New York who created a connection with me and said, ‘Hey, here’s the way it should go, and if it doesn’t go this way, here’s a number to call.’ It was just really a hand-off.” “There was a below-the-radar understanding that the [executives] of Elite [Casablancas and Marie] were sleeping with young women,” Kramer said. “I’m working at an agency where statutory rape is in front of my face and yet I can’t do anything.” Kramer said at 24 she herself was groped by a high-profile agent who went on to become an Elite executive. “I was sitting on his lap and his hands were all over me, coming around [my waist] and trying to grab my breast,” she said. “I didn’t react because I was so accustomed to seeing photographers be touchy-feely with models.” Kramer did not tell anyone at Elite about the misconduct, because she said it never occurred to her that such commonplace behavior was worth reporting, never mind addressing. And those who tried to call out problematic behavior didn’t get very far. In 2000, Anderson Boyd told New York Magazine that she remembered watching two female executives plead with Marie and Casablancas to stop sleeping with underage women. Anderson Boyd says Marie’s response was, “We are men. We have our needs.” “I was grossed out by what was happening,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost. “And that’s why I quit.” Ultimately, Anderson Boyd and Kramer agreed that Elite never trained agents to speak with models about sexual misconduct. Both women say they and other agents they knew did not prepare models for how to deal with predatory behavior.   “It was not handled like a traditional corporation where you’re handed a sexual harassment manual,” Anderson Boyd said. “I did not know how to help [the models’] working conditions.” Their account matches the experiences of women at other agencies at the time. For example, when former model Lesa Amoore was 17, she said her agent at the now-defunct Riccardo Gay Model Management company warned her that a photographer she was about to shoot with in Milan could “be a little weird.” Amoore said that during the subsequent shoot, when she was wearing only a bra and underwear, the photographer unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis and asked whether he could masturbate. According to the former model, now 48, she put on her clothes and ran out of the room. Amoore said that when she told her agent about the photographer’s behavior, he responded, “I’m so sorry, that happens sometimes with him.” Sara Ziff, who began modeling at age 14 in the late ’90s and later founded Model Alliance, told The New York Times last year that she too was regularly asked by photographers to get naked or topless without prior warning and, in at least one instance, was told to sit on her male booker’s lap.  “When I first started modeling, I did not feel protected by my agency [Next Management],” she told HuffPost. “In some cases, I felt like they were facilitating meetings [with powerful people] that were not clearly work opportunities ― they felt more like being set up on a date.” Though the modeling industry is now more regulated than it was in decades past, abuse is reportedly still frequent. A whopping 87 percent of models say they’ve been asked to get naked without prior warning, while 30 percent have experienced “inappropriate touching” on the job and 28 percent have been pressured to have sex at work, according to Model Alliance.

      "Document: Modeling Agencies Enabled Sexual Predators For Years, Former Agent Says. In October 2017, Carolyn Kramer received a disturbing phone call. The former modeling agent listened intently as a model she used to represent told her that a famous French photographer, who still shoots for top publications, raped her when she was 16. Shortly after meeting the man at a restaurant in 1983, the model said she blacked out after drinking one glass of champagne, then woke up in his bed the next morning with a sore and bruised vagina. The woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed this story with HuffPost, but did not want to name the photographer for fear of legal repercussions. “He was one of the photographers that agents and clients and young girls basically knew was lecherous,” Kramer said, claiming that she and other agents sent their models to him in the ’80s anyway. “[But] what I didn’t realize [at the time] is that he was raping girls.”  Kramer said she broke down crying after the woman relayed her story of assault. “In that moment I felt that I let down the models who I represented over the course of 20 years,” she said. “It made me feel like, here it is in front of my face now and I didn’t do anything to change [it.]” It’s been 14 years since Kramer left the fashion business. But throughout the two decades she spent working as a modeling agent in New York City in the 1980s, ’90s and early 2000s, Kramer said she knew about rampant sexual misconduct in her industry ― and didn’t protect her models from the egregious behavior. Now, amid the domino-like fall of so many high-profile alleged sexual offenders, the 58-year-old can’t stop thinking about how she and other agents sent girls, some as young as 13, to modeling gigs with photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators. So in October, the former agent decided to speak out.  “Many of these girls who are assaulted [as models] aren’t older than 15 years old,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “And I stand here to say how ashamed I am of myself for not having had the tools or the resources or guts to stop it.” Kramer’s peers queued up in the post’s comments section to corroborate her story. One of her former colleagues, ex-model Kristen Noel, said her agency, Elite Model Management, sent her to Paris in the early ’80s to stay with an agent who repeatedly groped and forcibly kissed her. She was 16. “Elite protected him and disconnected from their responsibility to me,” Noel told HuffPost.  Another commenter, hair and makeup artist Dawn Jacobson, said she saw agencies regularly endanger models when she worked in Milan in the ’80s. According to her, companies sent young women to live in residences ― one of which was reportedly known as “Clitoride,” Italian for “clitoris” ― where they were preyed on by wealthy Italian men. “I think the agencies have massive culpability because they don’t necessarily care about anything other than who gets the booking,” the 59-year-old, who still works in fashion, told HuffPost. “It becomes a little bit of a human trafficking kind of thing.” Kramer’s post, her first public denouncement of the sexual harassment and abuse she’d witnessed and heard about in the fashion industry, clearly struck a nerve. As the #MeToo revolution continues to spark a national dialogue on sexual misconduct, the former agent wants to expose exactly how the very modeling agencies she worked for enabled predators, a disturbing reality that she believes still exists today.  Kramer, a New Jersey native, doesn’t seem like the type to stay silent. She has a self-described “big personality” and speaks bluntly with a slight New York accent. In a recent Facebook profile photo, she’s wearing a shirt that reads “Fuck Trump” and raising her middle finger. But since she retired from the fashion world in 2004, Kramer said she felt like nobody ― primarily, the media ― was interested in what she had to say.  Only recently, the former agent noted, have news outlets begun systematically covering the kinds of abuse allegations she wants to condemn. It’s true that sexual assault accusations made against fashion photographer Terry Richardson date back to 2001, and that he was only officially dropped by certain top magazines and brands in October 2017. (Richardson has long denied any nonconsensual behavior.) And while at least 18 current and former male models recently accused famed photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment (Weber has denied these claims), one of whom has filed a lawsuit, industry insiders claim there is a long list of predators who still thrive in a largely unregulated profession that combines young models, big male egos and drugs.  Kramer’s story dates back to 1983, when she was hired by the industry’s top agency, Elite Model Management, as an assistant booking agent in New York. Her previous fashion industry jobs had been horrible. Kramer once worked with a photographer who she said cornered her in his office and tried to forcibly kiss her. And she worked for Foster-Fell Model Management, which she called a “slimy, horrible” agency.  “The models were basically prostitutes,” she said. ”[The owner] would have parties I would be at with licentious business men who were only there to fuck the models.” (Jeremy Foster-Fell, who co-founded the now-defunct agency in 1970, denied these claims to HuffPost. “To say there was an arrangement of financial exchange and sexual favors would be completely out of whack,” he said, adding, however, that “if you’re looking after a whole bunch of good-looking ladies who are running around Manhattan, you’re going to be running into trouble here and there sometimes.”)  But at 24, Kramer found herself employed by the modeling world’s gold standard, an agency that represented Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, where she didn’t expect to encounter abusive men. Her transition to Elite was “like going from community college to Harvard,” she said. Sadly, Kramer’s optimism was quickly dashed.  At Elite New York, her job frequently involved booking models on “go-sees,” the name for appointments during which photographers or designers scout new faces for upcoming shoots. In these meetings, vulnerable young women’s success often depends on impressing (mostly) powerful men. Kramer said she and other Elite agents would send models, who in many cases were under 16 and had never been to New York City, on appointments with nothing more than subway fare and a map. According to Kramer, the girls mostly went alone, because at the time there were no laws requiring guardians to accompany underage models on shoots. New York passed a bill in 2013 that, among other things, requires models under 16 to have chaperones. But before that, a 2012 study by Model Alliance, an organization that advocates for labor rights in fashion, found that 52 percent of models are rarely or never accompanied by guardians to a shoot, despite the fact that the majority of models start working between age 13 and 16. Kramer quickly learned about the perils of go-sees and photo shoots. Though the former agent says that the models she represented at the time didn’t tell her directly about being sexually harassed or assaulted by photographers ― likely, she said, because they were terrified of losing job opportunities ― Kramer soon heard through industry gossip with colleagues who the predators were. “I wouldn’t have even called it a secret,” she said. “It was just sort of common hearsay that this list of photographers were pigs...I had to make the appointments with [these men]. It would make me gag, but I had to do my job or I’d be fired.”  Another Elite employee, Marie Anderson Boyd, who was an agent and vice president at the company’s Chicago office between 1985 and 1990, said models would regularly tell her about the sexual misconduct they experienced on go-sees. ”[Some photographers] will think nothing of walking over to some teen girl who’s brand new to the business, taking her top off, unbuttoning her bra and saying something like, ‘I want you to look at me and think of ... giving me oral sex,’” she said. “And a lot of girls have never even done that [before], so they don’t even know what the [photographers] mean.”  Anderson Boyd said she never told her managers at Elite about the models’ abusive stories, in part because executives like John Casablancas and Gerald Marie also allegedly engaged in misconduct. “They established a culture of compliance with sexually predatory behavior,” she said. “That trickled down into everything everybody did.”  Indeed, during Kramer’s first year at Elite, the agency’s late founder, the then-41-year-old Casablancas, was having a public affair with an underage model named Stephanie Seymour. Kramer was horrified that Casablancas, with his movie-star good looks and “intoxicating” charisma, was committing statutory rape.  “As a young little upstart, I was very in awe of him,” she said. “But at the same time I’m thinking to myself, Stephanie’s supposed to be at a Vogue shooting at 9 a.m. and she’s still in bed with John. I thought it was wrong and I honestly couldn’t believe it went on. It made me sick.” Other alleged abuses at Elite unfurled from there. Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris, was in his 30s when he allegedly raped a 17-year-old model named Carré Otis on multiple occasions, which she detailed in her 2011 memoir. At the time, Otis was temporarily staying with him while she was modeling abroad in the mid-’80s. She didn’t feel as though she could tell the agency about the abuse.  “When [Elite] New York said goodbye to me and put me in Gerald’s apartment, he was like my new owner,” Otis told HuffPost. “There was no one in New York who created a connection with me and said, ‘Hey, here’s the way it should go, and if it doesn’t go this way, here’s a number to call.’ It was just really a hand-off.” “There was a below-the-radar understanding that the [executives] of Elite [Casablancas and Marie] were sleeping with young women,” Kramer said. “I’m working at an agency where statutory rape is in front of my face and yet I can’t do anything.” Kramer said at 24 she herself was groped by a high-profile agent who went on to become an Elite executive. “I was sitting on his lap and his hands were all over me, coming around [my waist] and trying to grab my breast,” she said. “I didn’t react because I was so accustomed to seeing photographers be touchy-feely with models.” Kramer did not tell anyone at Elite about the misconduct, because she said it never occurred to her that such commonplace behavior was worth reporting, never mind addressing. And those who tried to call out problematic behavior didn’t get very far. In 2000, Anderson Boyd told New York Magazine that she remembered watching two female executives plead with Marie and Casablancas to stop sleeping with underage women. Anderson Boyd says Marie’s response was, “We are men. We have our needs.” “I was grossed out by what was happening,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost. “And that’s why I quit.” Ultimately, Anderson Boyd and Kramer agreed that Elite never trained agents to speak with models about sexual misconduct. Both women say they and other agents they knew did not prepare models for how to deal with predatory behavior.   “It was not handled like a traditional corporation where you’re handed a sexual harassment manual,” Anderson Boyd said. “I did not know how to help [the models’] working conditions.” Their account matches the experiences of women at other agencies at the time. For example, when former model Lesa Amoore was 17, she said her agent at the now-defunct Riccardo Gay Model Management company warned her that a photographer she was about to shoot with in Milan could “be a little weird.” Amoore said that during the subsequent shoot, when she was wearing only a bra and underwear, the photographer unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis and asked whether he could masturbate. According to the former model, now 48, she put on her clothes and ran out of the room. Amoore said that when she told her agent about the photographer’s behavior, he responded, “I’m so sorry, that happens sometimes with him.” Sara Ziff, who began modeling at age 14 in the late ’90s and later founded Model Alliance, told The New York Times last year that she too was regularly asked by photographers to get naked or topless without prior warning and, in at least one instance, was told to sit on her male booker’s lap.  “When I first started modeling, I did not feel protected by my agency [Next Management],” she told HuffPost. “In some cases, I felt like they were facilitating meetings [with powerful people] that were not clearly work opportunities ― they felt more like being set up on a date.” Though the modeling industry is now more regulated than it was in decades past, abuse is reportedly still frequent. A whopping 87 percent of models say they’ve been asked to get naked without prior warning, while 30 percent have experienced “inappropriate touching” on the job and 28 percent have been pressured to have sex at work, according to Model Alliance. Model Cameron Russell’s Instagram is filled with her own colleagues’ stories of being preyed on at go-sees and shoots. A 22-year-old model wrote about how a male photographer pulled down her bra and started kissing her breasts six months ago. Another woman recalled how, as a 14-year-old model, a photographer made her change in front of him, rubbed oil on her legs, and, after asking if she was a virgin, said, “You make me want to go to jail.” The collection of horror stories portrays male photographers masturbating in front of young models, asking for sexual favors, and, in one case, penetrating a 15-year-old with his finger to make the photos “look more sensual.” Ziff said that beyond adhering to the 2013 bill, even the best-intentioned agencies still don’t have firm policies in place to protect their models from sexual misconduct. “They tell the girls that if they are in a situation that feels uncomfortable: ‘Go to the bathroom and walk out,’ ‘Feel free to call me,’ and ‘You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,’” the 35-year-old explained. “[They should] take a preventative approach that doesn’t allow those situations to happen in the first place. It’s much easier said than done to walk out of a shoot, especially if you’re young, maybe English isn’t your first language, and you’re working with someone who could make or break your career.”  In fact, Model Alliance found that 70 percent of models surveyed didn’t feel they could report sexual misconduct to their agencies. Of those who did, two-thirds said their agents didn’t consider the behavior problematic, and, in a few cases, even encouraged models to sleep with predators to advance their careers.  Model Jason Boyce, who filed a lawsuit against Bruce Weber for sexual misconduct last year, is also suing his agency, Soul Artist Management. According to the court filing, Boyce claimed the agency knew about Weber’s predatory behavior and alleged that his agent told him to “nail” his shoot with the famous photographer. “The culture was: You did what you were told. That was how they sold it,” he said in an interview with The Business of Fashion. “If you do what I tell you, you’ll make it. ... My agent told me that all the time.” Jilian Gotlib, a manager and booking agent who worked for Elite in the ’80s and re-joined the company in 2005, spoke to HuffPost on behalf of the organization. She disputed Kramer’s assertion that agents knowingly sent models to photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators, suggesting that Kramer “goes overboard, maybe, with criticizing the industry.” “We would always be careful, check out [the photographer] and tell our models, ‘If [the photographers] ask you to do anything that we didn’t tell you was going to happen, let us know,’” she explained. “Some girls would just go ahead anyway, but we would always warn people: ‘Call me if anything seems untoward.’ I think we would try not to work with a lot of those photographers if we heard problems.” Trudi Tapscott, who worked as an agent and director at Elite from the early ’80s until the early ’90s, reiterated Gotlib’s point, explaining that she told young women about potentially creepy photographers ahead of time. “I’ve had very honest conversations [about] what to do when [photographers] do this and what to do when [photographers] do that,” she told HuffPost. However, Tapscott added: “At this point I consider [those conversations] complicit. But then I thought I was helping them survive, which sounds so stupid now.” As for alleged in-house predators such as Marie, Gotlib said, “I knew nothing about anything that might have been going on there.”  Throughout her career Kramer worked at four other agencies ― the now-defunct Name Management and Company Management, as well as Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency ― where she said she also regularly witnessed young girls being preyed on at dinner parties and clubs. She said agencies organized events at hot spots such as New York’s Indochine or the Ritz in Paris, where models mingled in clouds of cigarette smoke with important editors and photographers who could “make or break careers.” “I saw 14- and 15-year-olds sitting on the laps of these photographers,” she said. “These guys would just have their hands all over these girls.” Ultimately, Kramer said she didn’t think she could call out the complicit behavior without losing her job. “Working for Elite [and the other agencies] manipulated me into thinking it was OK,” she said. “I’m not trying to squiggle out of this, by the way. I’m sick to my stomach that I was part of this poison. It sickens me.”  Representatives for Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Kramer left the industry in 2004 when she was working at the Marilyn Model Agency, saying she was disgusted by how young the models had become. But the former agent said she didn’t process the sexual misconduct ― or her role in enabling it ― until the following year, when she planned to write a book about her career. “I really started becoming more in touch with, ‘Holy shit, what did I do? What did I see? What did I feel? What did I know?’” she said. Kramer never wrote the book, but since her October Facebook post, models have contacted her with more and more stories recalling sexual harassment and assault in the fashion world. Even before posting on social media, Kramer had started working with Ziff at Model Alliance to publicize industry abuse. The organization recently proposed a program to address sexual misconduct in the fashion, entertainment and media industries that would, among other things, have a third party provide sexual harassment training and implement proper complaint procedures. But Kramer says agents still working in the business aren’t embracing her efforts. “A lot of people aren’t talking to me anymore because they know I’m on top of this,” she said. “They are afraid of losing their standing with these photographers and editors.” There are still many “Terry Richardsons” in the industry, Kramer said, men whose predatory behavior the fashion world ignores. “We all knew Terry Richardson was sexually abusing these girls and yet we still kept sending them on go-sees and to the bookings themselves,” she said. “If you’ve got a $20 million Revlon contract weighing in the balance ... yet you know Terry is abusing these girls, what do we do? Do we say no to Terry? No, [we] don’t.” Moving forward, Kramer believes that if executives at top agencies spoke out about malpractice, they could truly force industrywide change. Kramer also thinks agencies need to stop accepting models under 16, but at the very least, she urges them to better protect young women against possible predators.  “If I could get the owners to say to themselves, ‘Maybe we shouldn’t send 14-year-olds out on go-sees,’ and, ‘Maybe we should make sure these photographers that are on the blacklist are never alone with a model,’ I would feel my own shame and guilt for not having done more when I was an agent [slightly dissipate],” she said. “[Then] maybe I’d be able to let myself off the hook a little bit.” Do you have a story about harassment or discrimination that you’d like to share?

      "Document: Modeling Agencies Enabled Sexual Predators For Years, Former Agent Says. In October 2017, Carolyn Kramer received a disturbing phone call. The former modeling agent listened intently as a model she used to represent told her that a famous French photographer, who still shoots for top publications, raped her when she was 16. Shortly after meeting the man at a restaurant in 1983, the model said she blacked out after drinking one glass of champagne, then woke up in his bed the next morning with a sore and bruised vagina. The woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed this story with HuffPost, but did not want to name the photographer for fear of legal repercussions. “He was one of the photographers that agents and clients and young girls basically knew was lecherous,” Kramer said, claiming that she and other agents sent their models to him in the ’80s anyway. “[But] what I didn’t realize [at the time] is that he was raping girls.”  Kramer said she broke down crying after the woman relayed her story of assault. “In that moment I felt that I let down the models who I represented over the course of 20 years,” she said. “It made me feel like, here it is in front of my face now and I didn’t do anything to change [it.]” It’s been 14 years since Kramer left the fashion business. But throughout the two decades she spent working as a modeling agent in New York City in the 1980s, ’90s and early 2000s, Kramer said she knew about rampant sexual misconduct in her industry ― and didn’t protect her models from the egregious behavior. Now, amid the domino-like fall of so many high-profile alleged sexual offenders, the 58-year-old can’t stop thinking about how she and other agents sent girls, some as young as 13, to modeling gigs with photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators. So in October, the former agent decided to speak out.  “Many of these girls who are assaulted [as models] aren’t older than 15 years old,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “And I stand here to say how ashamed I am of myself for not having had the tools or the resources or guts to stop it.” Kramer’s peers queued up in the post’s comments section to corroborate her story. One of her former colleagues, ex-model Kristen Noel, said her agency, Elite Model Management, sent her to Paris in the early ’80s to stay with an agent who repeatedly groped and forcibly kissed her. She was 16. “Elite protected him and disconnected from their responsibility to me,” Noel told HuffPost.  Another commenter, hair and makeup artist Dawn Jacobson, said she saw agencies regularly endanger models when she worked in Milan in the ’80s. According to her, companies sent young women to live in residences ― one of which was reportedly known as “Clitoride,” Italian for “clitoris” ― where they were preyed on by wealthy Italian men. “I think the agencies have massive culpability because they don’t necessarily care about anything other than who gets the booking,” the 59-year-old, who still works in fashion, told HuffPost. “It becomes a little bit of a human trafficking kind of thing.” Kramer’s post, her first public denouncement of the sexual harassment and abuse she’d witnessed and heard about in the fashion industry, clearly struck a nerve. As the #MeToo revolution continues to spark a national dialogue on sexual misconduct, the former agent wants to expose exactly how the very modeling agencies she worked for enabled predators, a disturbing reality that she believes still exists today.  Kramer, a New Jersey native, doesn’t seem like the type to stay silent. She has a self-described “big personality” and speaks bluntly with a slight New York accent. In a recent Facebook profile photo, she’s wearing a shirt that reads “Fuck Trump” and raising her middle finger. But since she retired from the fashion world in 2004, Kramer said she felt like nobody ― primarily, the media ― was interested in what she had to say.  Only recently, the former agent noted, have news outlets begun systematically covering the kinds of abuse allegations she wants to condemn. It’s true that sexual assault accusations made against fashion photographer Terry Richardson date back to 2001, and that he was only officially dropped by certain top magazines and brands in October 2017. (Richardson has long denied any nonconsensual behavior.) And while at least 18 current and former male models recently accused famed photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment (Weber has denied these claims), one of whom has filed a lawsuit, industry insiders claim there is a long list of predators who still thrive in a largely unregulated profession that combines young models, big male egos and drugs.  Kramer’s story dates back to 1983, when she was hired by the industry’s top agency, Elite Model Management, as an assistant booking agent in New York. Her previous fashion industry jobs had been horrible. Kramer once worked with a photographer who she said cornered her in his office and tried to forcibly kiss her. And she worked for Foster-Fell Model Management, which she called a “slimy, horrible” agency.  “The models were basically prostitutes,” she said. ”[The owner] would have parties I would be at with licentious business men who were only there to fuck the models.” (Jeremy Foster-Fell, who co-founded the now-defunct agency in 1970, denied these claims to HuffPost. “To say there was an arrangement of financial exchange and sexual favors would be completely out of whack,” he said, adding, however, that “if you’re looking after a whole bunch of good-looking ladies who are running around Manhattan, you’re going to be running into trouble here and there sometimes.”)  But at 24, Kramer found herself employed by the modeling world’s gold standard, an agency that represented Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, where she didn’t expect to encounter abusive men. Her transition to Elite was “like going from community college to Harvard,” she said. Sadly, Kramer’s optimism was quickly dashed.  At Elite New York, her job frequently involved booking models on “go-sees,” the name for appointments during which photographers or designers scout new faces for upcoming shoots. In these meetings, vulnerable young women’s success often depends on impressing (mostly) powerful men. Kramer said she and other Elite agents would send models, who in many cases were under 16 and had never been to New York City, on appointments with nothing more than subway fare and a map. According to Kramer, the girls mostly went alone, because at the time there were no laws requiring guardians to accompany underage models on shoots. New York passed a bill in 2013 that, among other things, requires models under 16 to have chaperones. But before that, a 2012 study by Model Alliance, an organization that advocates for labor rights in fashion, found that 52 percent of models are rarely or never accompanied by guardians to a shoot, despite the fact that the majority of models start working between age 13 and 16. Kramer quickly learned about the perils of go-sees and photo shoots. Though the former agent says that the models she represented at the time didn’t tell her directly about being sexually harassed or assaulted by photographers ― likely, she said, because they were terrified of losing job opportunities ― Kramer soon heard through industry gossip with colleagues who the predators were. “I wouldn’t have even called it a secret,” she said. “It was just sort of common hearsay that this list of photographers were pigs...I had to make the appointments with [these men]. It would make me gag, but I had to do my job or I’d be fired.”  Another Elite employee, Marie Anderson Boyd, who was an agent and vice president at the company’s Chicago office between 1985 and 1990, said models would regularly tell her about the sexual misconduct they experienced on go-sees. ”[Some photographers] will think nothing of walking over to some teen girl who’s brand new to the business, taking her top off, unbuttoning her bra and saying something like, ‘I want you to look at me and think of ... giving me oral sex,’” she said. “And a lot of girls have never even done that [before], so they don’t even know what the [photographers] mean.”  Anderson Boyd said she never told her managers at Elite about the models’ abusive stories, in part because executives like John Casablancas and Gerald Marie also allegedly engaged in misconduct. “They established a culture of compliance with sexually predatory behavior,” she said. “That trickled down into everything everybody did.”  Indeed, during Kramer’s first year at Elite, the agency’s late founder, the then-41-year-old Casablancas, was having a public affair with an underage model named Stephanie Seymour. Kramer was horrified that Casablancas, with his movie-star good looks and “intoxicating” charisma, was committing statutory rape.  “As a young little upstart, I was very in awe of him,” she said. “But at the same time I’m thinking to myself, Stephanie’s supposed to be at a Vogue shooting at 9 a.m. and she’s still in bed with John. I thought it was wrong and I honestly couldn’t believe it went on. It made me sick.” Other alleged abuses at Elite unfurled from there. Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris, was in his 30s when he allegedly raped a 17-year-old model named Carré Otis on multiple occasions, which she detailed in her 2011 memoir. At the time, Otis was temporarily staying with him while she was modeling abroad in the mid-’80s. She didn’t feel as though she could tell the agency about the abuse.  “When [Elite] New York said goodbye to me and put me in Gerald’s apartment, he was like my new owner,” Otis told HuffPost. “There was no one in New York who created a connection with me and said, ‘Hey, here’s the way it should go, and if it doesn’t go this way, here’s a number to call.’ It was just really a hand-off.” “There was a below-the-radar understanding that the [executives] of Elite [Casablancas and Marie] were sleeping with young women,” Kramer said. “I’m working at an agency where statutory rape is in front of my face and yet I can’t do anything.” Kramer said at 24 she herself was groped by a high-profile agent who went on to become an Elite executive. “I was sitting on his lap and his hands were all over me, coming around [my waist] and trying to grab my breast,” she said. “I didn’t react because I was so accustomed to seeing photographers be touchy-feely with models.” Kramer did not tell anyone at Elite about the misconduct, because she said it never occurred to her that such commonplace behavior was worth reporting, never mind addressing. And those who tried to call out problematic behavior didn’t get very far. In 2000, Anderson Boyd told New York Magazine that she remembered watching two female executives plead with Marie and Casablancas to stop sleeping with underage women. Anderson Boyd says Marie’s response was, “We are men. We have our needs.” “I was grossed out by what was happening,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost. “And that’s why I quit.” Ultimately, Anderson Boyd and Kramer agreed that Elite never trained agents to speak with models about sexual misconduct. Both women say they and other agents they knew did not prepare models for how to deal with predatory behavior.   “It was not handled like a traditional corporation where you’re handed a sexual harassment manual,” Anderson Boyd said. “I did not know how to help [the models’] working conditions.” Their account matches the experiences of women at other agencies at the time. For example, when former model Lesa Amoore was 17, she said her agent at the now-defunct Riccardo Gay Model Management company warned her that a photographer she was about to shoot with in Milan could “be a little weird.” Amoore said that during the subsequent shoot, when she was wearing only a bra and underwear, the photographer unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis and asked whether he could masturbate. According to the former model, now 48, she put on her clothes and ran out of the room. Amoore said that when she told her agent about the photographer’s behavior, he responded, “I’m so sorry, that happens sometimes with him.” Sara Ziff, who began modeling at age 14 in the late ’90s and later founded Model Alliance, told The New York Times last year that she too was regularly asked by photographers to get naked or topless without prior warning and, in at least one instance, was told to sit on her male booker’s lap.  “When I first started modeling, I did not feel protected by my agency [Next Management],” she told HuffPost. “In some cases, I felt like they were facilitating meetings [with powerful people] that were not clearly work opportunities ― they felt more like being set up on a date.” Though the modeling industry is now more regulated than it was in decades past, abuse is reportedly still frequent. A whopping 87 percent of models say they’ve been asked to get naked without prior warning, while 30 percent have experienced “inappropriate touching” on the job and 28 percent have been pressured to have sex at work, according to Model Alliance. Model Cameron Russell’s Instagram is filled with her own colleagues’ stories of being preyed on at go-sees and shoots. A 22-year-old model wrote about how a male photographer pulled down her bra and started kissing her breasts six months ago. Another woman recalled how, as a 14-year-old model, a photographer made her change in front of him, rubbed oil on her legs, and, after asking if she was a virgin, said, “You make me want to go to jail.” The collection of horror stories portrays male photographers masturbating in front of young models, asking for sexual favors, and, in one case, penetrating a 15-year-old with his finger to make the photos “look more sensual.” Ziff said that beyond adhering to the 2013 bill, even the best-intentioned agencies still don’t have firm policies in place to protect their models from sexual misconduct. “They tell the girls that if they are in a situation that feels uncomfortable: ‘Go to the bathroom and walk out,’ ‘Feel free to call me,’ and ‘You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,’” the 35-year-old explained. “[They should] take a preventative approach that doesn’t allow those situations to happen in the first place. It’s much easier said than done to walk out of a shoot, especially if you’re young, maybe English isn’t your first language, and you’re working with someone who could make or break your career.”  In fact, Model Alliance found that 70 percent of models surveyed didn’t feel they could report sexual misconduct to their agencies. Of those who did, two-thirds said their agents didn’t consider the behavior problematic, and, in a few cases, even encouraged models to sleep with predators to advance their careers.  Model Jason Boyce, who filed a lawsuit against Bruce Weber for sexual misconduct last year, is also suing his agency, Soul Artist Management. According to the court filing, Boyce claimed the agency knew about Weber’s predatory behavior and alleged that his agent told him to “nail” his shoot with the famous photographer. “The culture was: You did what you were told. That was how they sold it,” he said in an interview with The Business of Fashion. “If you do what I tell you, you’ll make it. ... My agent told me that all the time.” Jilian Gotlib, a manager and booking agent who worked for Elite in the ’80s and re-joined the company in 2005, spoke to HuffPost on behalf of the organization. She disputed Kramer’s assertion that agents knowingly sent models to photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators, suggesting that Kramer “goes overboard, maybe, with criticizing the industry.” “We would always be careful, check out [the photographer] and tell our models, ‘If [the photographers] ask you to do anything that we didn’t tell you was going to happen, let us know,’” she explained. “Some girls would just go ahead anyway, but we would always warn people: ‘Call me if anything seems untoward.’ I think we would try not to work with a lot of those photographers if we heard problems.” Trudi Tapscott, who worked as an agent and director at Elite from the early ’80s until the early ’90s, reiterated Gotlib’s point, explaining that she told young women about potentially creepy photographers ahead of time. “I’ve had very honest conversations [about] what to do when [photographers] do this and what to do when [photographers] do that,” she told HuffPost. However, Tapscott added: “At this point I consider [those conversations] complicit. But then I thought I was helping them survive, which sounds so stupid now.” As for alleged in-house predators such as Marie, Gotlib said, “I knew nothing about anything that might have been going on there.”  Throughout her career Kramer worked at four other agencies ― the now-defunct Name Management and Company Management, as well as Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency ― where she said she also regularly witnessed young girls being preyed on at dinner parties and clubs. She said agencies organized events at hot spots such as New York’s Indochine or the Ritz in Paris, where models mingled in clouds of cigarette smoke with important editors and photographers who could “make or break careers.” “I saw 14- and 15-year-olds sitting on the laps of these photographers,” she said. “These guys would just have their hands all over these girls.” Ultimately, Kramer said she didn’t think she could call out the complicit behavior without losing her job. “Working for Elite [and the other agencies] manipulated me into thinking it was OK,” she said. “I’m not trying to squiggle out of this, by the way. I’m sick to my stomach that I was part of this poison. It sickens me.”  Representatives for Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Kramer left the industry in 2004 when she was working at the Marilyn Model Agency, saying she was disgusted by how young the models had become. But the former agent said she didn’t process the sexual misconduct ― or her role in enabling it ― until the following year, when she planned to write a book about her career. “I really started becoming more in touch with, ‘Holy shit, what did I do? What did I see? What did I feel? What did I know?’” she said. Kramer never wrote the book, but since her October Facebook post, models have contacted her with more and more stories recalling sexual harassment and assault in the fashion world. Even before posting on social media, Kramer had started working with Ziff at Model Alliance to publicize industry abuse. The organization recently proposed a program to address sexual misconduct in the fashion, entertainment and media industries that would, among other things, have a third party provide sexual harassment training and implement proper complaint procedures. But Kramer says agents still working in the business aren’t embracing her efforts. “A lot of people aren’t talking to me anymore because they know I’m on top of this,” she said. “They are afraid of losing their standing with these photographers and editors.” There are still many “Terry Richardsons” in the industry, Kramer said, men whose predatory behavior the fashion world ignores. “We all knew Terry Richardson was sexually abusing these girls and yet we still kept sending them on go-sees and to the bookings themselves,” she said. “If you’ve got a $20 million Revlon contract weighing in the balance ... yet you know Terry is abusing these girls, what do we do? Do we say no to Terry? No, [we] don’t.” Moving forward, Kramer believes that if executives at top agencies spoke out about malpractice, they could truly force industrywide change.

      "Document: Modeling Agencies Enabled Sexual Predators For Years, Former Agent Says. In October 2017, Carolyn Kramer received a disturbing phone call. The former modeling agent listened intently as a model she used to represent told her that a famous French photographer, who still shoots for top publications, raped her when she was 16. Shortly after meeting the man at a restaurant in 1983, the model said she blacked out after drinking one glass of champagne, then woke up in his bed the next morning with a sore and bruised vagina. The woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed this story with HuffPost, but did not want to name the photographer for fear of legal repercussions. “He was one of the photographers that agents and clients and young girls basically knew was lecherous,” Kramer said, claiming that she and other agents sent their models to him in the ’80s anyway. “[But] what I didn’t realize [at the time] is that he was raping girls.”  Kramer said she broke down crying after the woman relayed her story of assault. “In that moment I felt that I let down the models who I represented over the course of 20 years,” she said. “It made me feel like, here it is in front of my face now and I didn’t do anything to change [it.]” It’s been 14 years since Kramer left the fashion business. But throughout the two decades she spent working as a modeling agent in New York City in the 1980s, ’90s and early 2000s, Kramer said she knew about rampant sexual misconduct in her industry ― and didn’t protect her models from the egregious behavior. Now, amid the domino-like fall of so many high-profile alleged sexual offenders, the 58-year-old can’t stop thinking about how she and other agents sent girls, some as young as 13, to modeling gigs with photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators. So in October, the former agent decided to speak out.  “Many of these girls who are assaulted [as models] aren’t older than 15 years old,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “And I stand here to say how ashamed I am of myself for not having had the tools or the resources or guts to stop it.” Kramer’s peers queued up in the post’s comments section to corroborate her story. One of her former colleagues, ex-model Kristen Noel, said her agency, Elite Model Management, sent her to Paris in the early ’80s to stay with an agent who repeatedly groped and forcibly kissed her. She was 16. “Elite protected him and disconnected from their responsibility to me,” Noel told HuffPost.  Another commenter, hair and makeup artist Dawn Jacobson, said she saw agencies regularly endanger models when she worked in Milan in the ’80s. According to her, companies sent young women to live in residences ― one of which was reportedly known as “Clitoride,” Italian for “clitoris” ― where they were preyed on by wealthy Italian men. “I think the agencies have massive culpability because they don’t necessarily care about anything other than who gets the booking,” the 59-year-old, who still works in fashion, told HuffPost. “It becomes a little bit of a human trafficking kind of thing.” Kramer’s post, her first public denouncement of the sexual harassment and abuse she’d witnessed and heard about in the fashion industry, clearly struck a nerve. As the #MeToo revolution continues to spark a national dialogue on sexual misconduct, the former agent wants to expose exactly how the very modeling agencies she worked for enabled predators, a disturbing reality that she believes still exists today.  Kramer, a New Jersey native, doesn’t seem like the type to stay silent. She has a self-described “big personality” and speaks bluntly with a slight New York accent. In a recent Facebook profile photo, she’s wearing a shirt that reads “Fuck Trump” and raising her middle finger. But since she retired from the fashion world in 2004, Kramer said she felt like nobody ― primarily, the media ― was interested in what she had to say.  Only recently, the former agent noted, have news outlets begun systematically covering the kinds of abuse allegations she wants to condemn. It’s true that sexual assault accusations made against fashion photographer Terry Richardson date back to 2001, and that he was only officially dropped by certain top magazines and brands in October 2017. (Richardson has long denied any nonconsensual behavior.) And while at least 18 current and former male models recently accused famed photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment (Weber has denied these claims), one of whom has filed a lawsuit, industry insiders claim there is a long list of predators who still thrive in a largely unregulated profession that combines young models, big male egos and drugs.  Kramer’s story dates back to 1983, when she was hired by the industry’s top agency, Elite Model Management, as an assistant booking agent in New York. Her previous fashion industry jobs had been horrible. Kramer once worked with a photographer who she said cornered her in his office and tried to forcibly kiss her. And she worked for Foster-Fell Model Management, which she called a “slimy, horrible” agency.  “The models were basically prostitutes,” she said. ”[The owner] would have parties I would be at with licentious business men who were only there to fuck the models.” (Jeremy Foster-Fell, who co-founded the now-defunct agency in 1970, denied these claims to HuffPost. “To say there was an arrangement of financial exchange and sexual favors would be completely out of whack,” he said, adding, however, that “if you’re looking after a whole bunch of good-looking ladies who are running around Manhattan, you’re going to be running into trouble here and there sometimes.”)  But at 24, Kramer found herself employed by the modeling world’s gold standard, an agency that represented Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, where she didn’t expect to encounter abusive men. Her transition to Elite was “like going from community college to Harvard,” she said. Sadly, Kramer’s optimism was quickly dashed.  At Elite New York, her job frequently involved booking models on “go-sees,” the name for appointments during which photographers or designers scout new faces for upcoming shoots. In these meetings, vulnerable young women’s success often depends on impressing (mostly) powerful men. Kramer said she and other Elite agents would send models, who in many cases were under 16 and had never been to New York City, on appointments with nothing more than subway fare and a map. According to Kramer, the girls mostly went alone, because at the time there were no laws requiring guardians to accompany underage models on shoots. New York passed a bill in 2013 that, among other things, requires models under 16 to have chaperones. But before that, a 2012 study by Model Alliance, an organization that advocates for labor rights in fashion, found that 52 percent of models are rarely or never accompanied by guardians to a shoot, despite the fact that the majority of models start working between age 13 and 16. Kramer quickly learned about the perils of go-sees and photo shoots. Though the former agent says that the models she represented at the time didn’t tell her directly about being sexually harassed or assaulted by photographers ― likely, she said, because they were terrified of losing job opportunities ― Kramer soon heard through industry gossip with colleagues who the predators were. “I wouldn’t have even called it a secret,” she said. “It was just sort of common hearsay that this list of photographers were pigs...I had to make the appointments with [these men]. It would make me gag, but I had to do my job or I’d be fired.”  Another Elite employee, Marie Anderson Boyd, who was an agent and vice president at the company’s Chicago office between 1985 and 1990, said models would regularly tell her about the sexual misconduct they experienced on go-sees. ”[Some photographers] will think nothing of walking over to some teen girl who’s brand new to the business, taking her top off, unbuttoning her bra and saying something like, ‘I want you to look at me and think of ... giving me oral sex,’” she said. “And a lot of girls have never even done that [before], so they don’t even know what the [photographers] mean.”  Anderson Boyd said she never told her managers at Elite about the models’ abusive stories, in part because executives like John Casablancas and Gerald Marie also allegedly engaged in misconduct. “They established a culture of compliance with sexually predatory behavior,” she said. “That trickled down into everything everybody did.”  Indeed, during Kramer’s first year at Elite, the agency’s late founder, the then-41-year-old Casablancas, was having a public affair with an underage model named Stephanie Seymour. Kramer was horrified that Casablancas, with his movie-star good looks and “intoxicating” charisma, was committing statutory rape.  “As a young little upstart, I was very in awe of him,” she said. “But at the same time I’m thinking to myself, Stephanie’s supposed to be at a Vogue shooting at 9 a.m. and she’s still in bed with John. I thought it was wrong and I honestly couldn’t believe it went on. It made me sick.” Other alleged abuses at Elite unfurled from there. Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris, was in his 30s when he allegedly raped a 17-year-old model named Carré Otis on multiple occasions, which she detailed in her 2011 memoir. At the time, Otis was temporarily staying with him while she was modeling abroad in the mid-’80s. She didn’t feel as though she could tell the agency about the abuse.  “When [Elite] New York said goodbye to me and put me in Gerald’s apartment, he was like my new owner,” Otis told HuffPost. “There was no one in New York who created a connection with me and said, ‘Hey, here’s the way it should go, and if it doesn’t go this way, here’s a number to call.’ It was just really a hand-off.” “There was a below-the-radar understanding that the [executives] of Elite [Casablancas and Marie] were sleeping with young women,” Kramer said. “I’m working at an agency where statutory rape is in front of my face and yet I can’t do anything.” Kramer said at 24 she herself was groped by a high-profile agent who went on to become an Elite executive. “I was sitting on his lap and his hands were all over me, coming around [my waist] and trying to grab my breast,” she said. “I didn’t react because I was so accustomed to seeing photographers be touchy-feely with models.” Kramer did not tell anyone at Elite about the misconduct, because she said it never occurred to her that such commonplace behavior was worth reporting, never mind addressing. And those who tried to call out problematic behavior didn’t get very far. In 2000, Anderson Boyd told New York Magazine that she remembered watching two female executives plead with Marie and Casablancas to stop sleeping with underage women. Anderson Boyd says Marie’s response was, “We are men. We have our needs.” “I was grossed out by what was happening,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost. “And that’s why I quit.” Ultimately, Anderson Boyd and Kramer agreed that Elite never trained agents to speak with models about sexual misconduct. Both women say they and other agents they knew did not prepare models for how to deal with predatory behavior.   “It was not handled like a traditional corporation where you’re handed a sexual harassment manual,” Anderson Boyd said. “I did not know how to help [the models’] working conditions.” Their account matches the experiences of women at other agencies at the time. For example, when former model Lesa Amoore was 17, she said her agent at the now-defunct Riccardo Gay Model Management company warned her that a photographer she was about to shoot with in Milan could “be a little weird.” Amoore said that during the subsequent shoot, when she was wearing only a bra and underwear, the photographer unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis and asked whether he could masturbate. According to the former model, now 48, she put on her clothes and ran out of the room. Amoore said that when she told her agent about the photographer’s behavior, he responded, “I’m so sorry, that happens sometimes with him.” Sara Ziff, who began modeling at age 14 in the late ’90s and later founded Model Alliance, told The New York Times last year that she too was regularly asked by photographers to get naked or topless without prior warning and, in at least one instance, was told to sit on her male booker’s lap.  “When I first started modeling, I did not feel protected by my agency [Next Management],” she told HuffPost. “In some cases, I felt like they were facilitating meetings [with powerful people] that were not clearly work opportunities ― they felt more like being set up on a date.” Though the modeling industry is now more regulated than it was in decades past, abuse is reportedly still frequent. A whopping 87 percent of models say they’ve been asked to get naked without prior warning, while 30 percent have experienced “inappropriate touching” on the job and 28 percent have been pressured to have sex at work, according to Model Alliance. Model Cameron Russell’s Instagram is filled with her own colleagues’ stories of being preyed on at go-sees and shoots. A 22-year-old model wrote about how a male photographer pulled down her bra and started kissing her breasts six months ago. Another woman recalled how, as a 14-year-old model, a photographer made her change in front of him, rubbed oil on her legs, and, after asking if she was a virgin, said, “You make me want to go to jail.” The collection of horror stories portrays male photographers masturbating in front of young models, asking for sexual favors, and, in one case, penetrating a 15-year-old with his finger to make the photos “look more sensual.” Ziff said that beyond adhering to the 2013 bill, even the best-intentioned agencies still don’t have firm policies in place to protect their models from sexual misconduct. “They tell the girls that if they are in a situation that feels uncomfortable: ‘Go to the bathroom and walk out,’ ‘Feel free to call me,’ and ‘You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,’” the 35-year-old explained. “[They should] take a preventative approach that doesn’t allow those situations to happen in the first place. It’s much easier said than done to walk out of a shoot, especially if you’re young, maybe English isn’t your first language, and you’re working with someone who could make or break your career.”  In fact, Model Alliance found that 70 percent of models surveyed didn’t feel they could report sexual misconduct to their agencies. Of those who did, two-thirds said their agents didn’t consider the behavior problematic, and, in a few cases, even encouraged models to sleep with predators to advance their careers.  Model Jason Boyce, who filed a lawsuit against Bruce Weber for sexual misconduct last year, is also suing his agency, Soul Artist Management. According to the court filing, Boyce claimed the agency knew about Weber’s predatory behavior and alleged that his agent told him to “nail” his shoot with the famous photographer. “The culture was: You did what you were told. That was how they sold it,” he said in an interview with The Business of Fashion. “If you do what I tell you, you’ll make it. ... My agent told me that all the time.” Jilian Gotlib, a manager and booking agent who worked for Elite in the ’80s and re-joined the company in 2005, spoke to HuffPost on behalf of the organization. She disputed Kramer’s assertion that agents knowingly sent models to photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators, suggesting that Kramer “goes overboard, maybe, with criticizing the industry.” “We would always be careful, check out [the photographer] and tell our models, ‘If [the photographers] ask you to do anything that we didn’t tell you was going to happen, let us know,’” she explained. “Some girls would just go ahead anyway, but we would always warn people: ‘Call me if anything seems untoward.’ I think we would try not to work with a lot of those photographers if we heard problems.” Trudi Tapscott, who worked as an agent and director at Elite from the early ’80s until the early ’90s, reiterated Gotlib’s point, explaining that she told young women about potentially creepy photographers ahead of time. “I’ve had very honest conversations [about] what to do when [photographers] do this and what to do when [photographers] do that,” she told HuffPost. However, Tapscott added: “At this point I consider [those conversations] complicit. But then I thought I was helping them survive, which sounds so stupid now.” As for alleged in-house predators such as Marie, Gotlib said, “I knew nothing about anything that might have been going on there.”  Throughout her career Kramer worked at four other agencies ― the now-defunct Name Management and Company Management, as well as Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency ― where she said she also regularly witnessed young girls being preyed on at dinner parties and clubs. She said agencies organized events at hot spots such as New York’s Indochine or the Ritz in Paris, where models mingled in clouds of cigarette smoke with important editors and photographers who could “make or break careers.” “I saw 14- and 15-year-olds sitting on the laps of these photographers,” she said. “These guys would just have their hands all over these girls.” Ultimately, Kramer said she didn’t think she could call out the complicit behavior without losing her job. “Working for Elite [and the other agencies] manipulated me into thinking it was OK,” she said. “I’m not trying to squiggle out of this, by the way. I’m sick to my stomach that I was part of this poison. It sickens me.”  Representatives for Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Kramer left the industry in 2004 when she was working at the Marilyn Model Agency, saying she was disgusted by how young the models had become. But the former agent said she didn’t process the sexual misconduct ― or her role in enabling it ― until the following year, when she planned to write a book about her career. “I really started becoming more in touch with, ‘Holy shit, what did I do? What did I see? What did I feel? What did I know?’” she said. Kramer never wrote the book, but since her October Facebook post, models have contacted her with more and more stories recalling sexual harassment and assault in the fashion world. Even before posting on social media, Kramer had started working with Ziff at Model Alliance to publicize industry abuse. The organization recently proposed a program to address sexual misconduct in the fashion, entertainment and media industries that would, among other things, have a third party provide sexual harassment training and implement proper complaint procedures. But Kramer says agents still working in the business aren’t embracing her efforts. “A lot of people aren’t talking to me anymore because they know I’m on top of this,” she said. “They are afraid of losing their standing with these photographers and editors.” There are still many “Terry Richardsons” in the industry, Kramer said, men whose predatory behavior the fashion world ignores. “We all knew Terry Richardson was sexually abusing these girls and yet we still kept sending them on go-sees and to the bookings themselves,” she said. “If you’ve got a $20 million Revlon contract weighing in the balance ... yet you know Terry is abusing these girls, what do we do? Do we say no to Terry? No, [we] don’t.” Moving forward, Kramer believes that if executives at top agencies spoke out about malpractice, they could truly force industrywide change. Kramer also thinks agencies need to stop accepting models under 16, but at the very least, she urges them to better protect young women against possible predators.  “If I could get the owners to say to themselves, ‘Maybe we shouldn’t send 14-year-olds out on go-sees,’ and, ‘Maybe we should make sure these photographers that are on the blacklist are never alone with a model,’ I would feel my own shame and guilt for not having done more when I was an agent [slightly dissipate],” she said. “[Then] maybe I’d be able to let myself off the hook a little bit.” Do you have a story about harassment or discrimination that you’d like to share?

And she worked for Foster-Fell Model Management, which she called a “slimy, horrible” agency.  “The models were basically prostitutes,” she said. ”[The owner] would have parties I would be at with licentious business men who were only there to fuck the models.” (Jeremy Foster-Fell, who co-founded the now-defunct agency in 1970, denied these claims to HuffPost. “To say there was an arrangement of financial exchange and sexual favors would be completely out of whack,” he said, adding, however, that “if you’re looking after a whole bunch of good-looking ladies who are running around Manhattan, you’re going to be running into trouble here and there sometimes.”)  But at 24, Kramer found herself employed by the modeling world’s gold standard, an agency that represented Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, where she didn’t expect to encounter abusive men. Her transition to Elite was “like going from community college to Harvard,” she said. Sadly, Kramer’s optimism was quickly dashed.  At Elite New York, her job frequently involved booking models on “go-sees,” the name for appointments during which photographers or designers scout new faces for upcoming shoots. In these meetings, vulnerable young women’s success often depends on impressing (mostly) powerful men. Kramer said she and other Elite agents would send models, who in many cases were under 16 and had never been to New York City, on appointments with nothing more than subway fare and a map. According to Kramer, the girls mostly went alone, because at the time there were no laws requiring guardians to accompany underage models on shoots. New York passed a bill in 2013 that, among other things, requires models under 16 to have chaperones. But before that, a 2012 study by Model Alliance, an organization that advocates for labor rights in fashion, found that 52 percent of models are rarely or never accompanied by guardians to a shoot, despite the fact that the majority of models start working between age 13 and 16. Kramer quickly learned about the perils of go-sees and photo shoots. Though the former agent says that the models she represented at the time didn’t tell her directly about being sexually harassed or assaulted by photographers ― likely, she said, because they were terrified of losing job opportunities ― Kramer soon heard through industry gossip with colleagues who the predators were. “I wouldn’t have even called it a secret,” she said. “It was just sort of common hearsay that this list of photographers were pigs...I had to make the appointments with [these men]. It would make me gag, but I had to do my job or I’d be fired.”  Another Elite employee, Marie Anderson Boyd, who was an agent and vice president at the company’s Chicago office between 1985 and 1990, said models would regularly tell her about the sexual misconduct they experienced on go-sees. ”[Some photographers] will think nothing of walking over to some teen girl who’s brand new to the business, taking her top off, unbuttoning her bra and saying something like, ‘I want you to look at me and think of ... giving me oral sex,’” she said. “And a lot of girls have never even done that [before], so they don’t even know what the [photographers] mean.”  Anderson Boyd said she never told her managers at Elite about the models’ abusive stories, in part because executives like John Casablancas and Gerald Marie also allegedly engaged in misconduct. “They established a culture of compliance with sexually predatory behavior,” she said. “That trickled down into everything everybody did.”  Indeed, during Kramer’s first year at Elite, the agency’s late founder, the then-41-year-old Casablancas, was having a public affair with an underage model named Stephanie Seymour. Kramer was horrified that Casablancas, with his movie-star good looks and “intoxicating” charisma, was committing statutory rape.  “As a young little upstart, I was very in awe of him,” she said. “But at the same time I’m thinking to myself, Stephanie’s supposed to be at a Vogue shooting at 9 a.m. and she’s still in bed with John. I thought it was wrong and I honestly couldn’t believe it went on. It made me sick.” Other alleged abuses at Elite unfurled from there. Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris, was in his 30s when he allegedly raped a 17-year-old model named Carré Otis on multiple occasions, which she detailed in her 2011 memoir. At the time, Otis was temporarily staying with him while she was modeling abroad in the mid-’80s. She didn’t feel as though she could tell the agency about the abuse.  “When [Elite] New York said goodbye to me and put me in Gerald’s apartment, he was like my new owner,” Otis told HuffPost. “There was no one in New York who created a connection with me and said, ‘Hey, here’s the way it should go, and if it doesn’t go this way, here’s a number to call.’ It was just really a hand-off.” “There was a below-the-radar understanding that the [executives] of Elite [Casablancas and Marie] were sleeping with young women,” Kramer said. “I’m working at an agency where statutory rape is in front of my face and yet I can’t do anything.” Kramer said at 24 she herself was groped by a high-profile agent who went on to become an Elite executive. “I was sitting on his lap and his hands were all over me, coming around [my waist] and trying to grab my breast,” she said. “I didn’t react because I was so accustomed to seeing photographers be touchy-feely with models.” Kramer did not tell anyone at Elite about the misconduct, because she said it never occurred to her that such commonplace behavior was worth reporting, never mind addressing. And those who tried to call out problematic behavior didn’t get very far. In 2000, Anderson Boyd told New York Magazine that she remembered watching two female executives plead with Marie and Casablancas to stop sleeping with underage women. Anderson Boyd says Marie’s response was, “We are men. We have our needs.” “I was grossed out by what was happening,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost. “And that’s why I quit.” Ultimately, Anderson Boyd and Kramer agreed that Elite never trained agents to speak with models about sexual misconduct. Both women say they and other agents they knew did not prepare models for how to deal with predatory behavior.   “It was not handled like a traditional corporation where you’re handed a sexual harassment manual,” Anderson Boyd said. “I did not know how to help [the models’] working conditions.” Their account matches the experiences of women at other agencies at the time. For example, when former model Lesa Amoore was 17, she said her agent at the now-defunct Riccardo Gay Model Management company warned her that a photographer she was about to shoot with in Milan could “be a little weird.” Amoore said that during the subsequent shoot, when she was wearing only a bra and underwear, the photographer unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis and asked whether he could masturbate. According to the former model, now 48, she put on her clothes and ran out of the room. Amoore said that when she told her agent about the photographer’s behavior, he responded, “I’m so sorry, that happens sometimes with him.” Sara Ziff, who began modeling at age 14 in the late ’90s and later founded Model Alliance, told The New York Times last year that she too was regularly asked by photographers to get naked or topless without prior warning and, in at least one instance, was told to sit on her male booker’s lap.  “When I first started modeling, I did not feel protected by my agency [Next Management],” she told HuffPost. “In some cases, I felt like they were facilitating meetings [with powerful people] that were not clearly work opportunities ― they felt more like being set up on a date.” Though the modeling industry is now more regulated than it was in decades past, abuse is reportedly still frequent. A whopping 87 percent of models say they’ve been asked to get naked without prior warning, while 30 percent have experienced “inappropriate touching” on the job and 28 percent have been pressured to have sex at work, according to Model Alliance. Model Cameron Russell’s Instagram is filled with her own colleagues’ stories of being preyed on at go-sees and shoots. A 22-year-old model wrote about how a male photographer pulled down her bra and started kissing her breasts six months ago. Another woman recalled how, as a 14-year-old model, a photographer made her change in front of him, rubbed oil on her legs, and, after asking if she was a virgin, said, “You make me want to go to jail.” The collection of horror stories portrays male photographers masturbating in front of young models, asking for sexual favors, and, in one case, penetrating a 15-year-old with his finger to make the photos “look more sensual.” Ziff said that beyond adhering to the 2013 bill, even the best-intentioned agencies still don’t have firm policies in place to protect their models from sexual misconduct. “They tell the girls that if they are in a situation that feels uncomfortable: ‘Go to the bathroom and walk out,’ ‘Feel free to call me,’ and ‘You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,’” the 35-year-old explained. “[They should] take a preventative approach that doesn’t allow those situations to happen in the first place. It’s much easier said than done to walk out of a shoot, especially if you’re young, maybe English isn’t your first language, and you’re working with someone who could make or break your career.”  In fact, Model Alliance found that 70 percent of models surveyed didn’t feel they could report sexual misconduct to their agencies. Of those who did, two-thirds said their agents didn’t consider the behavior problematic, and, in a few cases, even encouraged models to sleep with predators to advance their careers.  Model Jason Boyce, who filed a lawsuit against Bruce Weber for sexual misconduct last year, is also suing his agency, Soul Artist Management. According to the court filing, Boyce claimed the agency knew about Weber’s predatory behavior and alleged that his agent told him to “nail” his shoot with the famous photographer. “The culture was: You did what you were told. That was how they sold it,” he said in an interview with The Business of Fashion. “If you do what I tell you, you’ll make it. ... My agent told me that all the time.” Jilian Gotlib, a manager and booking agent who worked for Elite in the ’80s and re-joined the company in 2005, spoke to HuffPost on behalf of the organization. She disputed Kramer’s assertion that agents knowingly sent models to photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators, suggesting that Kramer “goes overboard, maybe, with criticizing the industry.” “We would always be careful, check out [the photographer] and tell our models, ‘If [the photographers] ask you to do anything that we didn’t tell you was going to happen, let us know,’” she explained. “Some girls would just go ahead anyway, but we would always warn people: ‘Call me if anything seems untoward.’ I think we would try not to work with a lot of those photographers if we heard problems.” Trudi Tapscott, who worked as an agent and director at Elite from the early ’80s until the early ’90s, reiterated Gotlib’s point, explaining that she told young women about potentially creepy photographers ahead of time. “I’ve had very honest conversations [about] what to do when [photographers] do this and what to do when [photographers] do that,” she told HuffPost. However, Tapscott added: “At this point I consider [those conversations] complicit. But then I thought I was helping them survive, which sounds so stupid now.” As for alleged in-house predators such as Marie, Gotlib said, “I knew nothing about anything that might have been going on there.”  Throughout her career Kramer worked at four other agencies ― the now-defunct Name Management and Company Management, as well as Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency ― where she said she also regularly witnessed young girls being preyed on at dinner parties and clubs. She said agencies organized events at hot spots such as New York’s Indochine or the Ritz in Paris, where models mingled in clouds of cigarette smoke with important editors and photographers who could “make or break careers.” “I saw 14- and 15-year-olds sitting on the laps of these photographers,” she said. “These guys would just have their hands all over these girls.” Ultimately, Kramer said she didn’t think she could call out the complicit behavior without losing her job. “Working for Elite [and the other agencies] manipulated me into thinking it was OK,” she said. “I’m not trying to squiggle out of this, by the way. I’m sick to my stomach that I was part of this poison. It sickens me.”  Representatives for Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Kramer left the industry in 2004 when she was working at the Marilyn Model Agency, saying she was disgusted by how young the models had become. But the former agent said she didn’t process the sexual misconduct ― or her role in enabling it ― until the following year, when she planned to write a book about her career. “I really started becoming more in touch with, ‘Holy shit, what did I do? What did I see? What did I feel? What did I know?’” she said. Kramer never wrote the book, but since her October Facebook post, models have contacted her with more and more stories recalling sexual harassment and assault in the fashion world. Even before posting on social media, Kramer had started working with Ziff at Model Alliance to publicize industry abuse. The organization recently proposed a program to address sexual misconduct in the fashion, entertainment and media industries that would, among other things, have a third party provide sexual harassment training and implement proper complaint procedures. But Kramer says agents still working in the business aren’t embracing her efforts. “A lot of people aren’t talking to me anymore because they know I’m on top of this,” she said. “They are afraid of losing their standing with these photographers and editors.” There are still many “Terry Richardsons” in the industry, Kramer said, men whose predatory behavior the fashion world ignores. “We all knew Terry Richardson was sexually abusing these girls and yet we still kept sending them on go-sees and to the bookings themselves,” she said. “If you’ve got a $20 million Revlon contract weighing in the balance ... yet you know Terry is abusing these girls, what do we do? Do we say no to Terry? No, [we] don’t.” Moving forward, Kramer believes that if executives at top agencies spoke out about malpractice, they could truly force industrywide change. Kramer also thinks agencies need to stop accepting models under 16, but at the very least, she urges them to better protect young women against possible predators.  “If I could get the owners to say to themselves, ‘Maybe we shouldn’t send 14-year-olds out on go-sees,’ and, ‘Maybe we should make sure these photographers that are on the blacklist are never alone with a model,’ I would feel my own shame and guilt for not having done more when I was an agent [slightly dissipate],” she said. “[Then] maybe I’d be able to let myself off the hook a little bit.” Do you have a story about harassment or discrimination that you’d like to share?

      "Multiple women have accused Broadway star Ben Vereen of sexual misconduct ranging from harassment to assault, according to a Friday morning report from the New York Daily News. The alleged sexual misconduct happened during Vereen’s tenure as director of the 2015 production of “Hair” at the Venice Theatre program outside of Tampa, Florida. Vereen, who was 69 at the time, held open auditions for the production and later managed the 32-person volunteer cast. Four female cast members told the New York Daily News that Vereen repeatedly and forcibly kissed and hugged them without their consent. Several other cast members corroborated their experiences, telling the New York Daily News that Vereen routinely made degrading comments about female cast members’ bodies during rehearsals and one time stripped naked with the cast during what he called an acting exercise.  Two of the four women alleged that Vereen invited them separately over to his home in September 2015 for “private rehearsals.” During these two incidences, Vereen allegedly coerced the women into getting naked and asked them to join him in the hot tub. According to the two accounts, Vereen pressed his erect penis into the women’s legs and made unwanted sexual advances.  “He was acting as my mentor, asking me about my parents, then that same night, he put me on his lap while I was crying, and I felt his erection,” Kaitlyn Terpstra, who was 22 at the time, told the New York Daily News.  “He asked me, ‘Feel that?’ It was terrifying. I said, ‘Feel what?’ I wanted to act like I didn’t. I pushed myself off with a laugh,” she continued. “Then later, he asked, ‘Do you think I want to fuck you?’ I said ‘Yes,’ and he got angry. He said, ‘Well, I don’t, and that’s unfortunate.’ He made me feel like I had my mind in the gutter.” The other woman, identified only as “Kim,” told the New York Daily News Vereen asked her to perform oral sex while they were in his hot tub. Kim, who was only 23 at the time, said she acquiesced and recalled feeling “confused.” “I didn’t feel like I had a choice,” she said. Kim said she willingly entered into a relationship with Vereen after that first encounter. Now, however, she believes it was because he manipulated and took advantage of her.  Vereen starred in the original Broadway production of “Hair” between 1968 and 1972, alternating between the roles of Claude and Hud. Many of the 2015 cast members (all of whom were volunteers looking to jumpstart their acting careers) said that they were in awe of Vereen’s iconic role and subsequent successful career, which made it easier for him to take advantage of them.    In a statement to HuffPost, Vereen did not deny the accusations and apologized for his actions: I would like to apologize directly to the female cast members of the musical Hair for my inappropriate conduct when I directed the production in 2015. While it was my intention to create an environment that replicated the themes of that musical during the rehearsal process, I have since come to understand that it is my conduct, not my intentions, which are relevant here. So I am not going to make any excuses because the only thing that matters here is acknowledging and apologizing for the effects of my conduct on the lives of these women. Going forward, my having come to terms with my past conduct will inform all my future interactions not only with women, but with all individuals. I hope these women will find it in their hearts to accept my sincere apology and forgive me. Murray Chase, executive director of the Venice Theatre, told New York Daily News that the theater is “working to strengthen our sexual harassment policies and procedures, including the reporting of them, to prevent any future occurrences.” \n",
      "In October 2017, Carolyn Kramer received a disturbing phone call. The former modeling agent listened intently as a model she used to represent told her that a famous French photographer, who still shoots for top publications, raped her when she was 16. Shortly after meeting the man at a restaurant in 1983, the model said she blacked out after drinking one glass of champagne, then woke up in his bed the next morning with a sore and bruised vagina. The woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed this story with HuffPost, but did not want to name the photographer for fear of legal repercussions. “He was one of the photographers that agents and clients and young girls basically knew was lecherous,” Kramer said, claiming that she and other agents sent their models to him in the ’80s anyway. “[But] what I didn’t realize [at the time] is that he was raping girls.”  Kramer said she broke down crying after the woman relayed her story of assault. “In that moment I felt that I let down the models who I represented over the course of 20 years,” she said. “It made me feel like, here it is in front of my face now and I didn’t do anything to change [it.]” It’s been 14 years since Kramer left the fashion business. But throughout the two decades she spent working as a modeling agent in New York City in the 1980s, ’90s and early 2000s, Kramer said she knew about rampant sexual misconduct in her industry ― and didn’t protect her models from the egregious behavior. Now, amid the domino-like fall of so many high-profile alleged sexual offenders, the 58-year-old can’t stop thinking about how she and other agents sent girls, some as young as 13, to modeling gigs with photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators. So in October, the former agent decided to speak out.  “Many of these girls who are assaulted [as models] aren’t older than 15 years old,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “And I stand here to say how ashamed I am of myself for not having had the tools or the resources or guts to stop it.” Kramer’s peers queued up in the post’s comments section to corroborate her story. One of her former colleagues, ex-model Kristen Noel, said her agency, Elite Model Management, sent her to Paris in the early ’80s to stay with an agent who repeatedly groped and forcibly kissed her. She was 16. “Elite protected him and disconnected from their responsibility to me,” Noel told HuffPost.  Another commenter, hair and makeup artist Dawn Jacobson, said she saw agencies regularly endanger models when she worked in Milan in the ’80s. According to her, companies sent young women to live in residences ― one of which was reportedly known as “Clitoride,” Italian for “clitoris” ― where they were preyed on by wealthy Italian men. “I think the agencies have massive culpability because they don’t necessarily care about anything other than who gets the booking,” the 59-year-old, who still works in fashion, told HuffPost. “It becomes a little bit of a human trafficking kind of thing.” Kramer’s post, her first public denouncement of the sexual harassment and abuse she’d witnessed and heard about in the fashion industry, clearly struck a nerve. As the #MeToo revolution continues to spark a national dialogue on sexual misconduct, the former agent wants to expose exactly how the very modeling agencies she worked for enabled predators, a disturbing reality that she believes still exists today.  Kramer, a New Jersey native, doesn’t seem like the type to stay silent. She has a self-described “big personality” and speaks bluntly with a slight New York accent. In a recent Facebook profile photo, she’s wearing a shirt that reads “Fuck Trump” and raising her middle finger. But since she retired from the fashion world in 2004, Kramer said she felt like nobody ― primarily, the media ― was interested in what she had to say.  Only recently, the former agent noted, have news outlets begun systematically covering the kinds of abuse allegations she wants to condemn. It’s true that sexual assault accusations made against fashion photographer Terry Richardson date back to 2001, and that he was only officially dropped by certain top magazines and brands in October 2017. (Richardson has long denied any nonconsensual behavior.) And while at least 18 current and former male models recently accused famed photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment (Weber has denied these claims), one of whom has filed a lawsuit, industry insiders claim there is a long list of predators who still thrive in a largely unregulated profession that combines young models, big male egos and drugs.  Kramer’s story dates back to 1983, when she was hired by the industry’s top agency, Elite Model Management, as an assistant booking agent in New York. Her previous fashion industry jobs had been horrible. Kramer once worked with a photographer who she said cornered her in his office and tried to forcibly kiss her. And she worked for Foster-Fell Model Management, which she called a “slimy, horrible” agency.  “The models were basically prostitutes,” she said. ”[The owner] would have parties I would be at with licentious business men who were only there to fuck the models.” (Jeremy Foster-Fell, who co-founded the now-defunct agency in 1970, denied these claims to HuffPost. “To say there was an arrangement of financial exchange and sexual favors would be completely out of whack,” he said, adding, however, that “if you’re looking after a whole bunch of good-looking ladies who are running around Manhattan, you’re going to be running into trouble here and there sometimes.”)  But at 24, Kramer found herself employed by the modeling world’s gold standard, an agency that represented Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, where she didn’t expect to encounter abusive men. Her transition to Elite was “like going from community college to Harvard,” she said. Sadly, Kramer’s optimism was quickly dashed.  At Elite New York, her job frequently involved booking models on “go-sees,” the name for appointments during which photographers or designers scout new faces for upcoming shoots. In these meetings, vulnerable young women’s success often depends on impressing (mostly) powerful men. Kramer said she and other Elite agents would send models, who in many cases were under 16 and had never been to New York City, on appointments with nothing more than subway fare and a map. According to Kramer, the girls mostly went alone, because at the time there were no laws requiring guardians to accompany underage models on shoots. New York passed a bill in 2013 that, among other things, requires models under 16 to have chaperones. But before that, a 2012 study by Model Alliance, an organization that advocates for labor rights in fashion, found that 52 percent of models are rarely or never accompanied by guardians to a shoot, despite the fact that the majority of models start working between age 13 and 16. Kramer quickly learned about the perils of go-sees and photo shoots. Though the former agent says that the models she represented at the time didn’t tell her directly about being sexually harassed or assaulted by photographers ― likely, she said, because they were terrified of losing job opportunities ― Kramer soon heard through industry gossip with colleagues who the predators were. “I wouldn’t have even called it a secret,” she said. “It was just sort of common hearsay that this list of photographers were pigs...I had to make the appointments with [these men]. It would make me gag, but I had to do my job or I’d be fired.”  Another Elite employee, Marie Anderson Boyd, who was an agent and vice president at the company’s Chicago office between 1985 and 1990, said models would regularly tell her about the sexual misconduct they experienced on go-sees. ”[Some photographers] will think nothing of walking over to some teen girl who’s brand new to the business, taking her top off, unbuttoning her bra and saying something like, ‘I want you to look at me and think of ... giving me oral sex,’” she said. “And a lot of girls have never even done that [before], so they don’t even know what the [photographers] mean.”  Anderson Boyd said she never told her managers at Elite about the models’ abusive stories, in part because executives like John Casablancas and Gerald Marie also allegedly engaged in misconduct. “They established a culture of compliance with sexually predatory behavior,” she said. “That trickled down into everything everybody did.”  Indeed, during Kramer’s first year at Elite, the agency’s late founder, the then-41-year-old Casablancas, was having a public affair with an underage model named Stephanie Seymour. Kramer was horrified that Casablancas, with his movie-star good looks and “intoxicating” charisma, was committing statutory rape.  “As a young little upstart, I was very in awe of him,” she said. “But at the same time I’m thinking to myself, Stephanie’s supposed to be at a Vogue shooting at 9 a.m. and she’s still in bed with John. I thought it was wrong and I honestly couldn’t believe it went on. It made me sick.” Other alleged abuses at Elite unfurled from there. Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris, was in his 30s when he allegedly raped a 17-year-old model named Carré Otis on multiple occasions, which she detailed in her 2011 memoir. At the time, Otis was temporarily staying with him while she was modeling abroad in the mid-’80s. She didn’t feel as though she could tell the agency about the abuse.  “When [Elite] New York said goodbye to me and put me in Gerald’s apartment, he was like my new owner,” Otis told HuffPost. “There was no one in New York who created a connection with me and said, ‘Hey, here’s the way it should go, and if it doesn’t go this way, here’s a number to call.’ It was just really a hand-off.” “There was a below-the-radar understanding that the [executives] of Elite [Casablancas and Marie] were sleeping with young women,” Kramer said. “I’m working at an agency where statutory rape is in front of my face and yet I can’t do anything.” Kramer said at 24 she herself was groped by a high-profile agent who went on to become an Elite executive. “I was sitting on his lap and his hands were all over me, coming around [my waist] and trying to grab my breast,” she said. “I didn’t react because I was so accustomed to seeing photographers be touchy-feely with models.” Kramer did not tell anyone at Elite about the misconduct, because she said it never occurred to her that such commonplace behavior was worth reporting, never mind addressing. And those who tried to call out problematic behavior didn’t get very far. In 2000, Anderson Boyd told New York Magazine that she remembered watching two female executives plead with Marie and Casablancas to stop sleeping with underage women. Anderson Boyd says Marie’s response was, “We are men. We have our needs.” “I was grossed out by what was happening,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost. “And that’s why I quit.” Ultimately, Anderson Boyd and Kramer agreed that Elite never trained agents to speak with models about sexual misconduct. Both women say they and other agents they knew did not prepare models for how to deal with predatory behavior.   “It was not handled like a traditional corporation where you’re handed a sexual harassment manual,” Anderson Boyd said. “I did not know how to help [the models’] working conditions.” Their account matches the experiences of women at other agencies at the time. For example, when former model Lesa Amoore was 17, she said her agent at the now-defunct Riccardo Gay Model Management company warned her that a photographer she was about to shoot with in Milan could “be a little weird.” Amoore said that during the subsequent shoot, when she was wearing only a bra and underwear, the photographer unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis and asked whether he could masturbate. According to the former model, now 48, she put on her clothes and ran out of the room. Amoore said that when she told her agent about the photographer’s behavior, he responded, “I’m so sorry, that happens sometimes with him.” Sara Ziff, who began modeling at age 14 in the late ’90s and later founded Model Alliance, told The New York Times last year that she too was regularly asked by photographers to get naked or topless without prior warning and, in at least one instance, was told to sit on her male booker’s lap.  “When I first started modeling, I did not feel protected by my agency [Next Management],” she told HuffPost. “In some cases, I felt like they were facilitating meetings [with powerful people] that were not clearly work opportunities ― they felt more like being set up on a date.” Though the modeling industry is now more regulated than it was in decades past, abuse is reportedly still frequent. A whopping 87 percent of models say they’ve been asked to get naked without prior warning, while 30 percent have experienced “inappropriate touching” on the job and 28 percent have been pressured to have sex at work, according to Model Alliance. Model Cameron Russell’s Instagram is filled with her own colleagues’ stories of being preyed on at go-sees and shoots. A 22-year-old model wrote about how a male photographer pulled down her bra and started kissing her breasts six months ago. Another woman recalled how, as a 14-year-old model, a photographer made her change in front of him, rubbed oil on her legs, and, after asking if she was a virgin, said, “You make me want to go to jail.” The collection of horror stories portrays male photographers masturbating in front of young models, asking for sexual favors, and, in one case, penetrating a 15-year-old with his finger to make the photos “look more sensual.” Ziff said that beyond adhering to the 2013 bill, even the best-intentioned agencies still don’t have firm policies in place to protect their models from sexual misconduct. “They tell the girls that if they are in a situation that feels uncomfortable: ‘Go to the bathroom and walk out,’ ‘Feel free to call me,’ and ‘You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to do,’” the 35-year-old explained. “[They should] take a preventative approach that doesn’t allow those situations to happen in the first place. It’s much easier said than done to walk out of a shoot, especially if you’re young, maybe English isn’t your first language, and you’re working with someone who could make or break your career.”  In fact, Model Alliance found that 70 percent of models surveyed didn’t feel they could report sexual misconduct to their agencies. Of those who did, two-thirds said their agents didn’t consider the behavior problematic, and, in a few cases, even encouraged models to sleep with predators to advance their careers.  Model Jason Boyce, who filed a lawsuit against Bruce Weber for sexual misconduct last year, is also suing his agency, Soul Artist Management. According to the court filing, Boyce claimed the agency knew about Weber’s predatory behavior and alleged that his agent told him to “nail” his shoot with the famous photographer. “The culture was: You did what you were told. That was how they sold it,” he said in an interview with The Business of Fashion. “If you do what I tell you, you’ll make it. ... My agent told me that all the time.” Jilian Gotlib, a manager and booking agent who worked for Elite in the ’80s and re-joined the company in 2005, spoke to HuffPost on behalf of the organization. She disputed Kramer’s assertion that agents knowingly sent models to photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators, suggesting that Kramer “goes overboard, maybe, with criticizing the industry.” “We would always be careful, check out [the photographer] and tell our models, ‘If [the photographers] ask you to do anything that we didn’t tell you was going to happen, let us know,’” she explained. “Some girls would just go ahead anyway, but we would always warn people: ‘Call me if anything seems untoward.’ I think we would try not to work with a lot of those photographers if we heard problems.” Trudi Tapscott, who worked as an agent and director at Elite from the early ’80s until the early ’90s, reiterated Gotlib’s point, explaining that she told young women about potentially creepy photographers ahead of time. “I’ve had very honest conversations [about] what to do when [photographers] do this and what to do when [photographers] do that,” she told HuffPost. However, Tapscott added: “At this point I consider [those conversations] complicit. But then I thought I was helping them survive, which sounds so stupid now.” As for alleged in-house predators such as Marie, Gotlib said, “I knew nothing about anything that might have been going on there.”  Throughout her career Kramer worked at four other agencies ― the now-defunct Name Management and Company Management, as well as Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency ― where she said she also regularly witnessed young girls being preyed on at dinner parties and clubs. She said agencies organized events at hot spots such as New York’s Indochine or the Ritz in Paris, where models mingled in clouds of cigarette smoke with important editors and photographers who could “make or break careers.” “I saw 14- and 15-year-olds sitting on the laps of these photographers,” she said. “These guys would just have their hands all over these girls.” Ultimately, Kramer said she didn’t think she could call out the complicit behavior without losing her job. “Working for Elite [and the other agencies] manipulated me into thinking it was OK,” she said. “I’m not trying to squiggle out of this, by the way. I’m sick to my stomach that I was part of this poison. It sickens me.”  Representatives for Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency did not respond to HuffPost’s request for comment. Kramer left the industry in 2004 when she was working at the Marilyn Model Agency, saying she was disgusted by how young the models had become. But the former agent said she didn’t process the sexual misconduct ― or her role in enabling it ― until the following year, when she planned to write a book about her career. “I really started becoming more in touch with, ‘Holy shit, what did I do? What did I see? What did I feel? What did I know?’” she said. Kramer never wrote the book, but since her October Facebook post, models have contacted her with more and more stories recalling sexual harassment and assault in the fashion world. Even before posting on social media, Kramer had started working with Ziff at Model Alliance to publicize industry abuse. The organization recently proposed a program to address sexual misconduct in the fashion, entertainment and media industries that would, among other things, have a third party provide sexual harassment training and implement proper complaint procedures. But Kramer says agents still working in the business aren’t embracing her efforts. “A lot of people aren’t talking to me anymore because they know I’m on top of this,” she said. “They are afraid of losing their standing with these photographers and editors.” There are still many “Terry Richardsons” in the industry, Kramer said, men whose predatory behavior the fashion world ignores. “We all knew Terry Richardson was sexually abusing these girls and yet we still kept sending them on go-sees and to the bookings themselves,” she said. “If you’ve got a $20 million Revlon contract weighing in the balance ... yet you know Terry is abusing these girls, what do we do? Do we say no to Terry? No, [we] don’t.” Moving forward, Kramer believes that if executives at top agencies spoke out about malpractice, they could truly force industrywide change. Kramer also thinks agencies need to stop accepting models under 16, but at the very least, she urges them to better protect young women against possible predators.  “If I could get the owners to say to themselves, ‘Maybe we shouldn’t send 14-year-olds out on go-sees,’ and, ‘Maybe we should make sure these photographers that are on the blacklist are never alone with a model,’ I would feel my own shame and guilt for not having done more when I was an agent [slightly dissipate],” she said. “[Then] maybe I’d be able to let myself off the hook a little bit.” Do you have a story about harassment or discrimination that you’d like to share?

      "'Dick Van Dyke' Cast Member Rose Marie Dead At 94. Actress Rose Marie, who rose to national fame in the 1960s playing wisecracking Sally Rogers on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” died Thursday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 94. Though the actress was best known for playing Sally Rogers, her show business career goes back 90 years, starting when she was a child singer performing under the name Baby Rose Marie. Born Rose Marie Mazetta, she was known as “the child wonder.” She starred on her NBC radio show at age 5, and played opposite W.C. Fields in the 1933 film “International House,” according to Variety. It wasn’t an easy life. In her 2002 autobiography Hold The Roses, the performer described her family in harsh terms: I was raised by a mother who was a naïve, Polish lady who believed everything she was told. My father was a tyrant who had another family and never married my mother. He gambled away all the money I made as a child and my mother never knew a thing about it. He beat me because he was jealous of anybody I ever went out with. Rose Marie said mobsters like Al Capone and Bugsy Siegel helped her career as a child star. She was one of the headliners when Siegel opened the Flamingo Hotel in Las Vegas in 1946, but her comedic career didn’t really take off until she was cast on “The Dick Van Dyke Show,” considered one of the all-time great sitcoms, in 1961. Marie appeared in all five seasons and was nominated for Emmys in 1963, 1964 and 1966, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The experience was a highlight of her life, she said in a 2004 interview with The Hollywood Reporter: We were always changing lines, even right up to the very minute of going on the air. If something didn’t work, it didn’t work. Sometimes guest stars would panic because they weren’t used to this. We were a tight-knit, hard-working crew. I couldn’t wait to get to the set each day. Rose Marie was a popular TV guest star through the 1970s, and received public attention earlier this year with the release of “Wait For Your Laugh,” a documentary film about her nine decades in showbiz. Earlier this month, she wrote a piece for The Hollywood Reporter about her own experience with sexual harassment during Hollywood’s golden age. Rose Marie was married to trumpeter Bobby Guy from 1946 until his death in 1964. She is survived by her daughter, Georgiana Marie, and her son-in-law, Steven Rodrigues.\n",
      "Women-Only Art Shows Stood Out In 2017. Let's Leave Them There.. Days after the 2016 presidential election, artist Roxanne Jackson impulsively posted a message on Facebook. “Hello female artists/curators! Let’s organize a NASTY WOMEN group show!!!” she wrote, invoking Donald Trump’s by then famous characterization of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. “Who’s interested???” An hour later, more than 300 women had responded, equally frustrated and appalled by the election of an accused sexual predator to the highest office in the country. They responded with such passion and excitement that Jackson and her co-organizer, curator Jessamyn Fiore, agreed they couldn’t turn anyone away from the show. Instead, the two resolved to exhibit all artworks submitted ― requiring only that the works measure under 12 inches in every direction. “The Nasty Women Art Show” opened in January, with work by 694 artists on view. The artworks were all priced under $100, with proceeds benefiting Planned Parenthood. In three days, the show sold out. It raised $42,500.  The idea quickly spread beyond New York, with sanctioned “Nasty Women” art shows popping up around the world ― in Arizona and Tennessee and Belgium and London. The next show is scheduled for January 2018 in Washington, D.C., on the anniversary of Trump’s inauguration.  The wild success of the “Nasty Women” art shows speaks to the climate of 2017, described by HuffPost’s Emma Gray as “the year women found their rage.” From the Women’s March in January, which New York magazine’s Jerry Saltz dubbed the “best art achievement of 2017,” to Time designating the “Silence Breakers” its person of the year in December, the past 360 or so days have been marked by a kind of collective outcry that’s been impossible to ignore.  But it’s inaccurate to suggest that 2017 alone prompted women to raise hell, as though they hadn’t before. It’s true that many people, particularly white women, were shocked by Trump’s election and what it suggested about our country, and leaped into action in response. Yet for others, particularly women of color, the discrimination and oppression on naked display in the Trumpian era have always been part of the American experience. And people have been protesting it for just as long. This truth was fiercely demonstrated by two sprawling exhibitions that showcased the radical art of women of color. In April, New York’s Brooklyn Museum opened “We Wanted a Revolution: Black Radical Women 1965-85,” which featured work from 40 artists, including Elizabeth Catlett, Loïs Mailou Jones, Lorraine O’Grady, Howardena Pindell and Faith Ringgold. The exhibition traced the rise of a distinctive African-American, feminist art movement in the 1960s, when artists like Emma Amos, Jae Jarrell and Barbara Jones-Hogu were among the few women represented in black artist circles. It followed the birth of all-women’s collectives like Where We At, which blended artistic practice with fundraising, community outreach, education and political action in 1971.  The exhibition was housed near one of the Brooklyn Museum’s most prized possessions, Judy Chicago’s famous 1970s installation “The Dinner Party.” Chicago’s name is central to most discussions of radical feminist art, while the names of women of color are often pushed to the margins. “We Wanted a Revolution” attempted to give those women, and their work, their due. “Liberation of Aunt Jemima: Cocktail,” for example, reflects artist Betye Saar’s mission to transfigure racist imagery into talismans of power. And “Confessions for Myself,” a 1972 sculpture by Barbara Chase-Riboud, is a towering knot of black patinated bronze with wool cascading gently down ― part metal wreckage, part feminine robe, a visual amalgamation of softness and strength. The group show highlighted how mainstream feminism in the ’60s and ’70s was a movement composed primarily of ― and made to benefit ― white, middle-class women. The art associated with such a movement, celebrated today in many museums’ permanent collections, was often incompatible with black women’s histories, anxieties and desires. To truly understand the era of activism and art, the show implicitly argued, historians have to look beyond. “What do black women feel about Women’s Lib?” Toni Morrison wrote in 1971 for The New York Times. “Distrust. It is white, therefore suspect. They look at white women and see them as the enemy ― for they know that racism is not confined to white men, and that there are more white women than men in this country, and that 53 percent of the population sustained an eloquent silence during times of greatest stress.” (It’s not clear what the “53 percent” statistic refers to, but the number is eerily familiar: It’s the same percentage of white women who voted for Donald Trump.) Five months after “We Wanted a Revolution” opened, Los Angeles’ Hammer Museum debuted “Radical Women: Latin American Art, 1960–1985,” a massive survey of work from more than 100 Latin American women artists from 15 countries. As with “We Wanted a Revolution,” most of the featured artists didn’t identify with feminism, a movement they considered “bourgeois and imperialistic.” Instead, the artists on view grappled with issues facing women ― maternity, eroticism, domesticity and gender-based violence ― through the lens of their respective countries. Cuban artist Marta María Pérez staged haunting portraits of her pregnant belly threatened by her own knife-wielding hand, a thinly veiled reference to Afro-Cuban superstitions that, along with the rest of her work, places Western myths about motherhood ― as immaculate and peaceful ― in stark relief. Also on view is Chilean artist Gloria Camiruaga’s 1984 film “Popsicles,” which shows her daughters chanting “Hail Mary” while licking ice pops with plastic soldiers in them. The piece considers the idea of childhood innocence against a backdrop of perpetual violence, the reality faced by kids growing up under Chile’s authoritarian military government. Several other all-women group exhibitions drew attention this year, including “NSFW: Female Gaze” at New York’s Museum of Sex, which focused on erotic work by younger artists, many of whom had never exhibited their work in a museum before. There was also a laundry list of overtly timely shows ― “She Inspires,” “Uprise/Angry Women,” “Secret Garden: The Female Gaze on Erotica” ― on view at New York’s Untitled Space. But critics praised both “We Wanted a Revolution” and “Radical Women” in particular, lauding them as overdue. Looking back, the shows stand out as two of the most rousing exhibitions of 2017. And they serve as interesting foils to shows like “Nasty Women,” which feature predominately young, white artists, underscoring how women of color have been making urgent, political artwork long before the Trump presidency. It’s ultimately heartening to see women-centric shows on view at wide-reaching institutions like the Hammer and the Brooklyn Museum, the latter of which dedicated an entire year to feminist programming. Given the archaic gender bias that still permeates the art world ― art by women typically sells for approximately half of what works by male artists fetch at auction ― these efforts are necessary. But they are not enough. Why? Because women artists account for fewer than a third of solo shows at major museums. And that imbalance has consequences. In a research paper published by Williams College, Paige Wilkinson found that a solo show opportunity at a major museum increases an artist’s auction sale prices, on average, from 7 to 13 percent, while a shot at a group museum show only yields a 1 to 2 percent increase. Likely, this has to do with exposure. A solo show sets one artist apart from the rest, elevating her stature in the process, while a group show lumps artists together, placing them on equal but often impersonal footing. They are grouped together because they are women, because they are black, because they are Latin American, and sometimes not much more. This kind of categorization, which can feel like siloing, exists outside the world of fine art as well. Earlier this month, musician Caroline Polachek expressed her frustration with the electronic festival Moogfest after she was placed in a lineup of female, trans and gender-nonconforming artists without her approval. “Gender is not a genre,” Polachek tweeted. “I don’t need a sympathy pedestal, esp[ecially] from a male curator. Take my name off this list and put me in the pit with the boys.” Polachek eventually dropped out of the festival altogether, because, she explained on Twitter, “I wanted to break the lane divisions and not be spotlighted for ‘historical underrepresentation.’” From the Inauguration Day march to “Nasty Women” exhibitions to a late sexual misconduct reckoning, 2017 will be remembered as the year women banded together. The momentum that erupts when women join forces, tell their stories and show their work deserves to be celebrated. But recognizing the accomplishments of women in groups runs the risk of reinforcing stereotypes that, among other things, cast women as competent collaborators who aren’t ready to stand on their own. For feminist artist collectives in the ’70s and ’80s, embracing “inherently conciliatory and cooperative” behavior provided opportunities for exposure and acclaim, turning a potential weakness into a source of strength. Yet at a certain point, we must challenge these tropes as much as we embrace them to our advantage. On top of praising “We Wanted a Revolution” and “Radical Women,” critics hailed a slew of solo shows from women artists ― including Carol Rama at the New Museum, Florine Stettheimer at the Jewish Museum and Agnes Martin at the Guggenheim ― most of whom are both white and dead. There were exceptions, including Belkis Ayón at the Fowler Museum and El Museo del Barrio and Toyin Ojih Odutola at the Whitney. But when it comes to emerging and established women artists of color, solo shows are still, disappointingly, deviations from the norm.  Looking ahead, women both within and outside the art world deserve to be recognized more as individuals, as powerful, significant and worthy in and of themselves. All-women group shows are convenient in their ability to address sweeping, historic inequalities. But artists like Pérez, O’Grady, Camiruaga and Pindell deserve the same treatment as their male contemporaries. If women-only art shows stood out in 2017, let’s leave them there. Let’s look forward to bigger and better, more radical and revolutionary work in 2018.\n"

This is what we have done,” Martin said as he backed Varadkar’s nomination as Taoiseach, a core commitment in their coalition pact struck in 2020. Under terms of that agreement, the nearly century-old rivals of Irish politics — Martin’s Fianna Fáil and Varadkar’s Fine Gael – formed their first joint government with support from a junior coalition partner, the Green Party. All three agreed that Martin would lead for the first 2 ½ years, Varadkar for the rest of an expected five-year administration.\""

Since then, over 30 men have come forward with accusations ranging from nonconsensual groping to the attempted rape of minors. Spacey, 62, initially responded to Rapp’s allegations with a muddled apology note in which he came out as gay (a deflection many criticized as conflating homosexuality and pedophilia) and claimed not to remember the incident, writing on Twitter, “If I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior, and I am sorry for the feelings he describes having carried with him all these years.” Following the initial wave of allegations, Spacey was dropped by his talent agency and publicist, fired from House of Cards, and scrubbed from film projects. He retreated from public life, with a representative telling Variety he was seeking “evaluation and treatment,” though he has occasionally resurfaced over the years to launch film comebacks and post bizarre defenses on YouTube and Twitter.\""
